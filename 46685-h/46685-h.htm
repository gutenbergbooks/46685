<div class='c009'><span class='small'>Hotel de Meurice, à Calais.</span></div>

<p class='c010' ><span class='sc'>My dear William</span>,</p>
<p class='c011' >When we called on you a few weeks since,
on our ride from Liverpool to Dover, you
desired a journal of that which was to follow
across France and to Florence. We embarked,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
then, at seven in the morning of the
4th of July, with no wind, but a heavy swell
and drizzling rain: D—— and myself, Fanny
and the patient Grizzel in their horse boxes,
with John (from Cork!) beside them, combing
tails and rubbing curb-chains—his resource
against ennui. Landed at ten: Fanny profiting
by her first free moment to bite a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douanier</span> who caressed her; and from his calling
obtained no more pity from the bystanders
than from John, who was grinning derision at
his “big ear-ring.” Worried by the Customhouse,
though we have nothing contraband.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">signalement</span> of the horses taken with care
and gravity: it would suit any grey mare
and bay pony in the world. The officers do not
quite understand the shining of their coats,
and (supposing them cleaned after the fashion
of spoons) asked John “with what powder?”
he has been rather awed by the ceremony of
receiving his passport, particularly when standing
up to be measured and described. We
remain here three days, as the inn is exceedingly
comfortable, but there is very little to
see; on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Place</span>, near the lighthouse
tower, stood, even in 1830, the ruins of the old
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Halle</span>, where John de Vienne the governor,
and Sire Walter de Mauny communicated the
hard terms of surrender to Eustache St. Pierre:
there is no trace of it now. The site of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
Pierre’s house is marked by a neat marble slab,
at the corner of the street which bears his
name. The building still called “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cour de
Guise</span>,” though it has been turned to various
purposes, rebuilt and altered, was the wool
staple originally built by Edward the Third of
England; and afterwards bestowed on Guise
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Balafré</span>, in reward of his services when
he retook Calais from the English in 1577.
The church has little worth notice excepting
its altar. The vessel, which in Louis the Thirteenth’s
time bore it from Genoa, on its way to
Antwerp, was wrecked on the Calais coast.
With its bassi-relievi and crowd of statues and
marble columns, it wants simplicity, and is
too large for the place it occupies; for the
roof appears to crush the glory of the Saviour.
The old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> who shows the church is most
proud of a Last Supper carved in relief, gilded
and coloured: he knocks on the head the
little figure of Christ to prove his assertion,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur c’est en bois!</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >In the old revolution this church was unprofaned:
a Club built before it masked
its entrance; and the then mayor of Calais
warned <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lebon</span> that he might enter if he would,
but that he could not answer for the temper
of his townsmen.</p>

<p class='c010' >The chief building in Calais is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel
de Ville</span> with its handsome tower, and a clock
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
which has a sweet clear chime; before it, each
on its pedestal, are the busts of Richelieu
and Guise <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Balafré</span>: that of Eustache St.
Pierre holds the place of honour on the façade.
To reward for the trouble of walking up stairs,
the old woman only exhibited two rooms, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">là
où l’on marie</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">là où l’on reçoit,</span>” she
called them: in the latter, Louis Philip, whom
the artist intended to smile, and who sneers
instead, occupies the wall opposite a Surrender
of Calais. The citadel is forbidden ground;
we were turned back by the sentinel, as we
were proceeding to search for the ruins of the
Chateau of Calais, in which, by Richard the
Second’s order, the Duke of Gloucester was imprisoned
and murdered; they are built into
a bastion, called that of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vieux Chateau.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >John has decided that eating a dinner in
France is the most wonderful thing which has
happened to him yet. He describes the spreading
a white cloth over his knees preparatory
to serving up soup, fish, made dishes and
dessert; he has made acquaintance with the
“Garçon d’Ecurie,” whose thin tall figure is
a contrast to his own, with its round head and
bowed legs. They keep up a conversation of
signs and contortions; this hot day they have
passed seated in a wheelbarrow on the sunny
side of the court-yard: it was first Pierre’s
place of repose, but beginning by sitting on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
the wheel, and encroaching by degrees, John
made it so uncomfortable to his comrade, that
he gained sole possession, and is now coiled up
asleep. He told me this morning that he must
go to church, the Irish father by whom he
was married a month ago not having “quite
done with him in the way of confession:” I
represented that these priests were Frenchmen;
that he said was of no consequence, “Clargy
spaking all kinds of languages.” He knew
but one exception, and that was the very
father who married him and could not speak
Irish; it was he who (by John’s account)
gave him a blow when instead of the fifteen
shillings he demanded he offered him five.</p>

<p class='c010' >The stout waiter François, known for four
and twenty years at the hotel, is as perfect
a specimen of French nature in his class, as
is John of that of Ireland. He informed me
he had lately crossed to England; an ordinary
intellect would have supposed it was to see
the country, or the coronation, but no, it was
to see <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lablache!</span> and being in London he also
saw <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Taglioni!!</span> and her dancing, he said, went
to his very soul. While we were at dinner,
a fair girl, with a wrinkled old woman on her
arm, looked in at the window and touched a
bad guitar: I said we wanted no music, and
François scolded her away, but as he stooped
down to arrange the fire, muttered in a low
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
voice, “It was true that she was troublesome,
and had only one excuse, she supported her
old mother.” We gave her something, and
François, whose face had grown radiant, told
us his own story, and how he had worked from
a boy with the hope of assisting his father,
and at last had purchased him an annuity of
600 francs, which the old man had enjoyed
thirteen years, proud in the gift of a son,
who, like Corporal Trim, thought that “Honour
thy father and thy mother” meant allowing
them a part of his earnings. “He had been
looked on as the best son of the province;”
and his own child had promised well likewise
but he died—he thought he might have weathered
the storm, but death, François said, was
the strongest and not to be battled with; and
with a mixture of feeling and philosophy, as
he changed my soup-plate, he shook his head
and added, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que voulez-vous?</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >D—— misses a Commissionaire, a civil
fellow well known to all who frequented the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hotel Meurice,</span> his story being romantic from
its commencement; he has become a hero
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malgré lui</span>; he was brought from Portugal
when a child by an officer of the 11th Regiment,
and left here when the army of occupation
quitted France. He travelled to Paris in
the July of 1830 and was there surprised by
the revolution. Being of a peaceable temper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
he hid himself within doors; through some
unlucky window a ball came and grazed his
arm, and, determined to profit by events if
possible, as soon as danger was passed he
emerged, showing his wounds and claiming
cross and pension; he has obtained both as
due to his merit, and is now a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gros portier
dans un hôtel de libéral.</span>” We walked this
lovely evening past the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Courtgain</span> to the Pier.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Courtgain</span> is the fishermen’s quarter,
being nothing more than a large bastion
ceded them, with permission to build, in 1622;
it contains seven very narrow streets. We
watched the fishing-boats towed out against
wind and tide by their owners’ wives and
daughters; the men look picturesque in their
red caps and high boots, and they crawl through
the mud and up the sides of their craft, with
two oars serving for ladder, with the dexterity
of cats. It blew fresh this evening;
the boats were out at sea a few moments
after the women let go the ropes at the pier
head. They did not murmur at their hard
work, nor did sign or token offer them thanks
for it. The skiffs sailed on and they just
glanced at them as they lessened in the distance,
and returned dragging along and scolding
disobedient children; yet the sky was wild
though the sun shone; sufficiently stormy to
make one wonder they looked no longer.</p>
<div class='c012'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
<span class='small'>St. Omer, July 8th, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande St. Catherine.</span></span></div>
<p class='c010' >One may certainly ride from Calais hither,
and say “it is all barren.” The soil seems a
deep sand, and we wondered that it could
produce even thin wheat and dry grass; crossed
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont Sans pareil,</span>” which is thrown over
the two canals, where they meet at right
angles. Twenty-six miles of broad straight
road, only enlivened by a few pollarded trees,
a great many windmills, some melancholy red
chateaux with great gates and long avenues,
and here and there villages of wretched cabins
each in its unwholesome enclosure; the green
pond in front and the tall trees around it: the
group surmounted by a spire. Such as they
are, they give the dead flat a look of the
living: but they are scantily scattered. Left
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ardres</span> to the right: it has been a strong
place, and is going to decay. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guines</span> is farther
on, and the field of “Cloth of Gold,”
which still bears its name, lies between them,
but not on the road: but for D——’s recollection
of 1815, and some interest in tracing
his old quarters, it would have been duller still.</p>

<p class='c010' >Approached St. Omer at last: rode between
rows of stripped elms with deplorable heads;
through a long suburb; along a fine avenue
skirting the fortifications, over bridges and
drawbridges unending, and we were in the town.
This is a good inn. We walked after dinner
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
to see the Abbey of St. Bertin; our guide
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grosse fille d’auberge.</span>” Its interior
was burned in the old revolution, and the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil Municipal,</span>” judging the safety of
the townsmen endangered, has caused all to
be taken down, saving a side wall and its
beautiful tower. English visitors still ascend
the latter for the sake of the view, but it
must be a work of danger; it is cracked to
the very top, and bends awfully. Over its
porch was a fresco painting, whose outline
and some faded colours remain, and above it,
sown there by some of the winds of heaven,
grows and flourishes a young pear tree.</p>

<p class='c010' >We seated ourselves on some timber to
look at the sunset and the falling abbey, and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fille d’auberge</span> sat down also. She
said all the small houses round were inhabited
by English, who admire ruins “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">furieusement.</span>”
When she was tired of talking
she remembered she was wanted and left us.
We returned ourselves through handsome desolate
streets, passing some hotels of Louis the
Thirteenth’s time, and many Spanish houses,
of I presume Queen Elizabeth’s date, for
they exhibit the gable peaked or in-steps of
stone, but have an ugly addition of shell-like
ornaments over doors and windows. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place du Haut Pont,</span> which we crossed, is surrounded
by these. The Place itself, with its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
crooked canal crossed by a wooden bridge and
disappearing under a dark arch of some ancient
building—the boats lying on the water ready
to depart for Dunkirk—a group of people
collected on its edge round a street singer—looked
in the red indistinct light like a Dutch
picture or a fragment of opera scenery.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>July 9th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >The cathedral is very fine, and we regretted
that an exceedingly gruff <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> would not
allow us to stay more than five minutes in the
lovely Gothic chapel behind the altar, which
would be faultless, but that it is over-painted
and gilded. Above the altar is a Crucifixion
in stone, with a background of stained glass,
through which the light comes on it with
great effect, but rather theatrically. At the
foot of the altar steps was a female figure
in almost modern costume, seated on the
floor, looking like a great wooden doll. What
she does there I cannot say, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span>
left me no time to examine. We were obliged
to rest satisfied with a passing glimpse of this,
and the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grilles de chapelles,</span>” on either side,
in fine Italian marble, and the tomb in the
nave of some monk or bishop who lies here in
costly effigy. We went thence to St. Denis.
Its exterior in some degree resembles St.
Bertin and Nôtre Dame, as its square tower
has the same character, but it has been pieced
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
and renewed within. It was “fête” in this
church, an old man said, and to do it honour
the high altar was ornamented with hundreds
of roses, and myrtle and orange-trees in their
tubs, ranged in the choir beneath the church
banners. On the right of the choir is the
altar of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacré Cœur,</span>” on either side of
which hang strings of silver hearts as big as
the palm of the hand, offerings of the faithful!</p>

<p class='c010' >On the left, in a hole sunk in the wall,
framed and lined with room-paper, except on
festivals screened from profane eyes by little
pink calico curtains, is a gilded bust of St.
Bertin, adorned with steel court buttons.
Walking down the aisle on this side we
arrived before the chapel of St. Hubert; we
looked through the grille, and saw on the
opposite wall a larger recess, its folding-doors
thrown back for the holiday. Within, the
saint (a foot high) kneels in a flowing wig
and Roman toga! a tiny tin <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cor de chasse,</span>
such as you have seen on the caps of the light
infantry of the National Guard, tacked to his
side! The background, a piece of room-paper
representing a great green tree; on which (in
relief of course) shines out a second and similar
hunting horn! The saint’s dog, in an attitude
of astonishment, gazes, as does Hubert,
on a small wooden stag, who stands on a rock;
the Crucifix and two Thieves springing from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
his forehead in place of antlers. Below is
written, “The Conversion of St. Hubert.”</p>

<p class='c010' >In a second recess of the same chapel, St.
Hubert reappears, rewarded; in gilded canonicals
and holding a bunch of flowers, but still
hangs at his girdle, to prove his identity, the
tin <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cor de chasse</span> of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet de Voltigeurs.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >I saw lower down a devout inscription
praying that “St. Joseph’s presence in that
spot might protect all carpenters,” and near
the entrance an ancient basso relievo brought
from the tomb of the Abbot of St. Bertin.</p>

<p class='c010' >We walked on to the college, and round its
fine courts. Some of the buildings bear the
date of Francis the First, but the church and
college themselves were erected by the Jesuits
in the time of their power—1629. The former
merely presents to the street a high ornamented
gable, and a vast space within not worth looking
at. Its curiosities (placed here temporarily)
are some bassi relievi of Spanish processions,
dug up some miles from St. Omer,
and a group representing St. Pepin (who was
the dwarf of his century) killing with his fist
a lion, who is gnawing a bull.</p>

<p class='c010' >The fire-engines are also here till the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel
de Ville,</span> which is in progress, shall be ready
to house them. I was surprised to see their
buckets are baskets saturated with pitch, and
hempen vessels of the same form, and to hear
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
they answer perfectly. We walked on the
ramparts which command the view of the prodigiously
strong fortifications, and the flat,
which can at pleasure be inundated a mile
round; but like the broad desolate streets,
the prospect is surpassingly melancholy.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lillers, Hotel de la Poste,</span> July 10th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >A fine avenue, leaving St. Omer; and a
rather more interesting country, through
which flows the little river. One hill in the
distance (which we took for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cassel</span>) breaking
the flat, and here and there, some rather pretty
looking hamlets—each cabin within its prairie;
but between these no sign of habitation.
The light sandy soil is extremely cultivated,
and the unending plain less sad now than it
will be later in the season, as the corn is in ear,
and the bean and poppy fields are in blossom.
From the seed of this purple and white poppy
is expressed salad oil. Aire, which we passed
through, is a picturesque, fortified town, its
ramparts shaded with fine green trees. Beyond
Aire, on each side of the grand route,
are numberless gardens, and it was gay and
sweet with flowers.</p>

<p class='c010' >At every mile we pass a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite chapelle,</span>”
being usually a small wooden case with a
glass door, perched on a pole, planted at the
road-side; and within, a tiny figure of the
virgin, attired in white muslin. I saw <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nôtre
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
Dame de Grâce, Nôtre Dame de Guerison,</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nôtre Dame de Bonne Fin;</span> the last with
no great pleasure, thinking she might be there
installed on account of the arrival of the black
fever, which is in Flanders. We fancied the
villagers looked pale, and passed at a gallop.</p>

<p class='c010' >John had arrived before us at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lillers</span>; and
fearing the diligence had taken him too far,
and unable to ask the name of the place in
which he was deposited, he locked up our
baggage in a room of the inn, and, with the
great key in his hand, was contemplating a
walk back to St. Omer. This inn is a mere
farm-house with bad accommodation; the
landlord and his friends sat smoking in the
room where we dined; he regrets we will not
walk three quarters of a league to the fête, and
the servant and the landlady’s daughter are
now describing Dominique’s dancing, and a
minute ago had nearly come to high words
about Dominique.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>St. Pol, July 11th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Started in burning weather, having found
no conveyance for John, who trudged after
cheerfully, though he says “it is these straight
roads what breaks the heart of a traveller.”
Stopped to rest whenever the shade of a bush
made it possible, for the fine trees which grew
here as well as on most of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grandes routes</span>
of France are all felled. Saw no traveller,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
excepting a white haired bishop, in his purple
robes, who passed in his carriage. John
said “he would have kneeled to ax a blessing
but he took him for an officer;” at last we
came up with a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite voiture,</span> within which we
deposited John, who directly commenced a conversation
no one was likely to sustain. Arrived
here ourselves, having suffered a good deal from
the intense heat; and drank some beer which
a peasant sold at four sous a quart, and explained
to her how I sat on Fanny having no
one behind to hold me on. Avoid this inn on
pain of bad meat, and bad beds, and mistakes
in the bill. Strolled out, for refreshment, in the
heavy dew, and finding a rather pretty walk
compared to the frightful plain, hailed as if
it had been Swiss scenery the dry bed of a
little stream with a bridge and broken bank,
shaded by young birch trees, and a path
winding upwards from it through corn and
bean fields and a tiny copse to the town.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doullens, le Grand Turc,</span> July 12th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left St. Pol at four in the afternoon, to
avoid the heat, and found it still so excessive
that we sat under the shade of the first trees
we found, and let the horses feed until the
sun declined. John was to follow in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service
des Dépêches,</span>” a heavy cab with a raw-boned
horse. The peasantry hereabouts are
worse lodged and more filthy than between
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
Calais and St. Omer. Woe to whom penetrate
within the prairie, or step across the
floor. The evening grew dark so suddenly
that we had some trouble in finding (not the
road, for there are no cross-ways or green lanes)
but its least stony part, in the steep rough
descent to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doullens;</span> took a poppy field for a
lake; it struck ten as we arrived in the bad
air of the narrow street, where reigns the Grand
Turk the moon rising as our ride ended. John
appeared in the mail a few minutes after; it
had changed horses on the road, but certainly
not fatigued either, for ours were not put out
of a walk. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fille d’auberge</span> blinded me by
holding her candle in my face to examine hat,
habit, and wearer, before she thought proper
to lead the way to a room. The atmosphere
abominable, and the draught which, when I
threw open the windows, came in from the
narrow street and dirty yard, worse than the air
it expelled. Nothing to be had but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café au lait</span>
and cherries, but the beds comfortable and the
dark-eyed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</span> good humoured. She swept
the room before breakfast this morning, and
the floor bore witness to its being a favour.</p>

<p class='c010' >We walked to the citadel, which is just
without the town, now occupied by only twenty-five
men; a pretty avenue leads to it up the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glacis.</span> We were admitted without difficulty,
though with some formality. The soldier at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
the gate summoned the Corporal; the Corporal
asked permission of the Commandant,
and returned to conduct us across the two
drawbridges. The form of the citadel is a
square, flanked at each angle by a bastion,
and defended by outworks. From his manners
and conversation, the Corporal might have
been a nobleman—for he had perfect ease and
no familiarity; he offered his hand to assist
me in climbing where it was rough and steep,
but only when assistance was necessary. On
the side of the citadel furthest from the town
is the place where political offenders were
confined some years back; it is a fort within
a fort, and has its own defences. The rampart
commands it, and its sentinel kept a constant
look out, yet, in spite of all precautions,
some escaped. They were retaken, but unpunished,
Louis Philip having shortly after
proclaimed his “general amnesty.” Subterranean
passages opening from this citadel
conduct to the town, and completely mine it.
The heat was so intense that we could not
make the entire tour, though it was only eleven
o’clock; the Corporal regretted being deprived
of the pleasure of accompanying us further,
and accepted the silver put in his hand without
looking at it, and with seeming reluctance,
as a physician does his first fee.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doullens</span> has belonged to many masters: to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
the Huguenots during the wars of religion, then
to their enemies, afterwards to the Spaniards,
who took it when Henry the Fourth was
yet unsettled on his throne. It was in 1595,
and the surprise of Amiens, which took place
two years after, was accomplished by the
governor of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doullens’</span> love for a fair widow.
The governor was the famous Captain Hernand
Teillo, and the lady the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dame de Monchy,</span>
who was rich as well as noble and beautiful.
“I was born at Amiens,” she replied proudly,
when he besought her to accept his hand:
“I will espouse no man unless we obey the
same royal master; either abandon the King
of Spain and become French as I am, or take
Amiens and make me a Spanish subject.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Adopting this last alternative, and having
sworn to succeed, the Spaniard Hernand
Teillo marched with his troops towards Amiens;
before day broke a strong detachment lay concealed
behind hedges near the town, the
chapel of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Montain</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Madelaine</span> were
occupied, and the cavalry concealed in a
valley; at dawn, Hernand Teillo having
made choice of sixteen soldiers and four officers
on whose resolution he could rely, disguised
the former as peasants and market
women, and sent them by different paths to
the gate of Amiens, carrying on their backs
market baskets of walnuts and apples; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
four officers, disguised in like manner, walked
beside a heavy cart laden with wood covered
over with straw; one acting as waggoner.
The movement of troops, however secretly
made, could not be entirely concealed, and
some peasants not counterfeits apprized the
governor of Amiens of what was passing;
it was said he had been bought over, at all
events he treated it as an idle report. At six
o’clock, the gates of the town being opened,
the sixteen soldiers, preceded by their officers
and waggon, boldly presented themselves for
admission at the gate called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montre Écu;</span>
arrived under the entrance arch, the waggon
stopped, and the waggoner silently cut the
traces that the portcullis might be arrested
in its fall; at the same moment, one of the
pretended peasants undid, as if by mistake,
the cord which fastened the mouth of a sack of
walnuts, and its contents were scattered on
the pavement. The guard was composed of
wretched mechanics (for Amiens, in her pride,
had refused a royal garrison); they abandoned
their post to seize on the prize, and the
Spaniards, drawing their arms from beneath
their clothes, in the course of a few moments
had massacred their unresisting enemies, and
gained possession of the guard house. The sentinel
placed on the gate heard the cries of the
wounded, and cut the ropes which upheld the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
portcullis, but the waggon was exactly beneath,
and the portcullis fell on it and fixed it there,
leaving the way open to the foe. The citizens
roused, came in numbers to repulse the
Spaniards who poured in, and to a body of
Irishmen under his command Hernand Teillo
owed in a great measure his success. In their
gallant defence of the town, perished numbers
of its inhabitants: the Comte de St. Pol,
governor of the province, failed to imitate their
noble example; for he fled, as soon as from
the tower of the royal chateau he inhabited
he recognised the red scarfs of the Spaniards.
The townsmen were disarmed the same day;
the sack of Amiens permitted for eight more;
and these past, the already ruined citizens
reduced to starvation by the exaction of heavy
sums of money. Married to the Lady of
Monchy, Hernand Teillo was rewarded for
his success: and Henry the Fourth of France,
after a night passed at a ball, had just lain down
to rest when the courier arrived with news
of the surprise of Amiens. Sully was summoned
to his bedside, and Henry, grasping
his hand in strong emotion, said, “I have
played the part of king of France long
enough; I must return to that of king of
Navarre.”</p>

<p class='c010' >All the nobility of France encamped before
Amiens; the effective force amounted to 18,000
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
men, and Hernand Teillo, reduced to extremity,
implored the assistance of the Archduke
Albert, who was at Arras, and who
arrived at the head of 4,000 horse and 15,000
foot. It is told that the day on which Henry
was informed of their approach, he rode to
a height whence he could distinguish the
Spanish army advancing in good order; and
leaning over his saddle bow, he prayed heaven,
“If his sins deserved heavy punishment to
strike the guilty: but not to scatter the flock
for the fault of the shepherd.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Hernand Teillo never knew that relief was
so near; he had already fallen by a musket
shot, near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte de Montre Écu</span>—that very
gate by which he entered. Beside it canvass
had been spread to conceal the workmen while
they repaired the breaches made in the rampart:
a French soldier fancied he saw a shade
through, and fired—it was Hernand Teillo.
His successor Montenegro surrendered Amiens
to King Henry on the 25th of September.</p>

<p class='c010' >We left <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doullens</span> at twelve, for I thought
no sun could be so terrible as the Grand
Turk’s air; but the heat proved more intense
than I ever felt it in France, and whenever
we found shade, which was but three times,
we stopped exhausted. Overtook, travelling
at this rate, John in the diligence; woke
a half-naked child which was blistering in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
the sun; let the horses drink in a pool of abomination,
and bought sour wine for ourselves—though
the greasy glass clasped in the black
paw almost conquered thirst. We began to
feel the effect of the rays on our head; I
could not without consideration recollect where
we were—and talking became so painful, that
we rode some hours in perfect silence, till we
came to a few yards of turf under half a
dozen trees, the first for miles; it was like a
bit of paradise. We staid there, the horses
feeding till the sun was low; and even then
the heat seemed undiminished, and the remaining
three leagues interminable, for cathedral
and town being built in a hollow,
the former towers in sight long before houses
are visible. Just as we were reviving in expectation
of an inn we came to a windmill,
slowly turning its sails in the light air, and
throwing long shadows, changing as they
turned, on the road before the horses’ feet:
it proved a foe to us as it did of yore to <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don
Quixote</span>; Fanny kicked, and the patient
Grizzel plunged, and a half hour’s course
of backing and beating was necessary to induce
them to pass. When we dismounted at
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel d’Angleterre</span> a fat old gentleman,
an “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitué</span>,” seated on the wicker-seat on
the shady side of the Cour under the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laurier-rose,</span>
asked the landlady, if we could be in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
our senses who travelled in such weather, and
in such a way? but D—— has suffered no
injury, and I, saving faintness and giddiness,
have escaped also.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>13th July.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We are warned against repeating our folly,
by the sight of a poor fellow, who, as I crossed
the court-yard, I found placed there in a chair
between two women, one of whom was sobbing
violently; I asked “what ailed her?” She
said she was his sister, and the other his wife;
that he had quitted home to come on a journey
here, and two days before on the river
had received a sunstroke. They were sent for,
and came instantly: he had not recognized
them or spoken; the physician said his tongue
was paralyzed. He had always been a good
husband, yet now when his fits of fury came
on, his violence was wholly directed against
his wife,—(I had not noticed before that he
wore a strait waistcoat): the poor wife said
nothing; she leaned on his chair looking at
him with red eyes, which seemed to have no
moisture left; and only shook her head, when
her sister added, that the Doctor rested a last
hope on his being taken home to his children.
I inquired if they wanted money? She said,
“they had been comfortable while they depended
on him, and would try to aid him in
turn;” she seemed too miserable to care about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
it, or even glance at what was given her.
The horses were put to a few minutes after,
and they led him to the coach; he walked like
a man in his sleep, and I think his sight is
impaired, for tho’ his face was flushed, his
eyes were like stone. While we were at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte,</span> a very undaunted looking ballad-singer
brought her harp to the door, and
reaped a good harvest: the landlord tried
to get up a subscription for the unfortunate
peasant, but failed.</p>

<p class='c010' >Here is the prettiest fair in the world: but
held within the precincts of an ancient church
and monastery, whose outer wall, still standing,
exhibits the remains of fine tombs defaced
and broken: part of the cloister, its arches
filled up with masonry, is there also; and
these make strange boundaries to ranges of
shops forming streets between avenues of
lime-trees, shows and buffoons, feats of horsemanship
and rope-dancing. If the nuns who
lie beneath the old monuments could look
forth, they would understand the meaning
of revolution. We walked to the fair after
dinner, when it was brilliantly lighted, and
the gay standings and green branches showed
to advantage. It is the resort of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau
monde</span> of Amiens, and its theatres and temporary
cafés were crowded. I asked the
meaning of the frequent discharges of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
musketry we heard—“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame,</span>” said a grave
shopman, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est la prise de Constantine!</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >The exhibition of paintings by Amiens
artists is held in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span>, and does
them no great honour: the subject of one picture
you will think curious. I copy from the
catalogue: “Christmas Eve: some good children
are employed in reverently gathering
together miraculous playthings, sent them by
the <i>Enfant Jésus</i> down the chimney”!!!</p>

<p class='c010' >The Gaol joins the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span>. As we
came out, we saw a crowd collected round
a large machine like an omnibus, except that
it received light and air from apertures in its
roof: it was marked “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service des Prisonniers,</span>”
and is destined to convey some convicts to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bicêtre</span> to-night: a better mode of transport
than dragging them along the road in chains.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beffroi</span>, a strange looking tower which
rises alone on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de l'Hôtel de Ville</span>,
now serves as a prison for minor offences: it
contains the great bell tolled on solemn occasions.
It is said that this tower was raised
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis le Gros,</span> but the town records make
no mention of it till the year 1244; it has
been twice consumed by fire—the first time
in 1524, when it was the scene of an awful
tragedy. The keeper had ascended to the
lantern at its top before the flames broke
forth: and when about to descend, found, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
his horror, that smoke and fire barred his
passage. He attempted to force his way, and
they drove him back; he rushed to the top
once more, and shrieked for assistance to the
terrified crowd: it was impossible to afford
it; and as the floor heated beneath his feet,
he implored, in his agony, that some one
present would fire on him. His sad prayer
was granted; and having recommended his
soul to God, he fell dead from a harquebuss
shot.</p>

<p class='c010' >There is a fine “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Établissement des Bains</span>”
near our hôtel, supplied by the river, but
before you go thither, do not, as I did, walk
in view of the filthy buildings which hang
over the Somme, as the muddy water causes
disagreeable associations, particularly as it
also washes the walls of the church in the
principal street, now converted into a splendid
hospital.</p>

<p class='c010' >I have said nothing of the Cathedral, yet
there we have passed the greater portion
of our time; and for its sake remain three
days at Amiens. Its foundations were laid
in 1220, when Everard was Bishop of Amiens,
and Louis the Eighth King of France. Excepting
its towers, it was finished about 1288.</p>

<p class='c010' >415 feet long within, 132 in height, its proportions
are so perfect, that its size fails to
strike, except by comparison. I was made
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
aware of it only by looking at a human figure
in the aisle. What a pity that bad taste should
have covered a great part of the carved stone
work, and several tombs in the chapels, with
painted and gilt wainscotings! Among the
latter, one in black marble of the churchman
who united Isabella of Bavaria, of infamous
memory, to Charles the Sixth, the royal maniac.
The gilding of the altar, railings, &amp;c. was
lately renewed by the testamentary donation
of an Englishman, who, together with his wife
and family, embraced the Catholic religion
here. They were converted, the landlady
tells me, by the wife of the English clergyman!
who herself had abjured protestantism
shortly before!! The little angel, who beside
the kneeling figure of a bishop weeps behind
the high altar, was so prized by the English,
that it is said they offered to purchase him
for his weight in gold. He sits with his head
leaned on his hand, and his legs hung carelessly
down—an image of all-absorbing
sorrow. The monument was an offering of
gratitude from its sculptor to the memory
of the prelate who had been his patron; but
why an ill-executed figure of the Virgin is
placed so close as to spoil the effect, no one
can tell.</p>

<p class='c010' >The organ is voiceless still, notwithstanding
the 40,000 francs spent this year on its repair.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
As we are to leave Amiens in the morning,
we returned to the Cathedral after dinner, as I
wished, in company of its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span>, to walk round
it once more—but that this man is straight,
and has two eyes, he might be the original of
Quasimodo. We were too early, and staid
outside to look again at the three beautiful
porches, deeply sunk in the noble façade,
among whose multitude of carved saints innumerable
birds have built their nests, in
cavities made by decapitated heads, and limbs
wanting; they were flying about in quantities.
As we entered, the priest was about to conclude
his evening sermon; we waited its close,
and I thought I had not seen the cathedral to
advantage before. The weather was burning
and cloudless; and while the coloured rosace
of the transept opposite us looked deeper and
richer, because, not fronting the west, it admitted
no sunbeams; they came through a
side window, and the whole cross aisle was
a flood of light: roof, columns, and arches
illuminated in all their details; and the figure
of Fenelon’s friend, half reclined on his tomb,
seemed about to start up. Through the
stained glass of the large rose above the
organ, and the smaller one on each side, the
glory from the west streamed in likewise,
brightening the gay dresses of the still congregation,
and the bare head of the energetic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
priest, and the pulpit, supported by the three
Cardinal Virtues, and surmounted by an angel
whose foot seems hardly to rest on its roof, and
whose hand points upward. You would have
moralized on the Virtues cowering in shadow,
and the winged form above them (like their
emanation) floating in splendour.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> came to conduct us: his pride
seemed centered in the cathedral, and in the
study of its walls he says he has passed wakeful
nights. The two bronzed monuments,
hardly raised from the floor to right and left
of the principal entrance, a human figure
rudely outlined on each, are those of the
founder Everard and his successor Godefroy.</p>

<p class='c010' >Walking up the left-hand aisle, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span>
pointed to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crucifix Miraculeux:</span> it is of
the seventh century, clad in long gilded
robes, wearing an expression, not of pain, but
triumph; such being the mode of representing
the Saviour before the time of Charlemagne.
The miracle on which rests its fame
consists in a change of lodging it one night
effected, for it was originally placed in a
chapel on the right of the nave. Why it preferred
one opposite, the tradition does not tell.</p>

<p class='c010' >Here, where the transept crosses the nave,
is the tomb of the ambassador who negotiated
peace between Francis the First of France and
the Emperor Charles. The emblematical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
figures are those of Force wresting a Salamander
from the grasp of Peace—Francis paid
tribute. An altar opposite, erected during a
plague, conceals the monument of a bishop,
who, holding the see of Amiens at the period
of the battle of Crecy, received and sheltered
Philip of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valois</span>. A pavement stone in the
transept marks the grave of Gresset. The
chapel near contains, in a superb reliquary, a
piece of the skull of John the Baptist! and
each time we have visited the cathedral, we
have seen the same old lady kneeling before
it, in immovable devotion. The curious stone
screen raised outside the choir represents the
various events of John the Baptist’s life; the
small figures, though rudely drawn, have great
expression; arches, canopies and pinnacles,
carved above them in the same stone, form a
light and beautiful frame. Formerly this
screen surrounded the choir; the taste of Louis
the Fifteenth’s time substituted the gilt
bronze railing. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> stopped a moment
to admire the weeping cherub and criticise
(not unskilfully) a beautiful Virgin, carved by
the same hand, in the chapel, behind the high
altar. A few steps further, the pavement
stones for a considerable space are marked
each with a deeply carved cross. It would
seem that here, during the religious wars,
there once took place a conflict between
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
Huguenots and Catholics, in which many of
the latter died. The pavement of the transept
has one grave-stone more near the side
entrance to the right; the initials it bears are
H. T. (Hernand Teillo), for he was buried
here; and it was of him that Henry the
Fourth, viewing his small armour, said, “I
had not believed so mighty a spirit could be
lodged so narrowly!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The carving of the screen, the canons’ seats,
&amp;c. of the choir, as they are celebrated for
their beauty, we wished to see nearer; but
their exhibition did not lie in our cicerone’s
department—he went in search of a fat woman
who has the key in charge. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur,</span>” he
said, smiling as he presented her, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est la
dame du cœur!</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >The sculptor of this fairy-work was by
agreement bound to sacred subjects; and only
an oversight left to his own taste the adorning
of the wood-work which divides the canons’
seats. The artist was acquainted with their
persons and histories; and when his task was
done, each found his elbow resting on an indiscreet
allusion to his life or himself. Some
chafed over their own grotesque portraits; a
meek looking young ass dressed in canonicals
gazed sympathetically in the face of another;
and the most unkindly treated of all beheld his
own figure in a contrite attitude, his own hands
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
receiving an infant from the hands of a lady!
We staid in the cathedral till the daylight
failed; and the high roof looked loftier when
we could barely distinguish where it rested on
the groups of slender columns. It will be
long ere we forget its beauty, and the beautiful
changes of its aspect; from the time its three
portals thrown open after evening service
admitted the whole flood of sunset, which lit it
up as for a rejoicing, till the glow had faded;
which it did so slowly, as if it had been loth
to leave it.</p>

<p class='c010' >Went to bed at twelve; a violent thunder-storm;
up again at three; off at four; and but
that the two hotel dogs followed us and we
turned back fearing to lose them, we were in a
fair way for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rouen;</span> as the roads join and we
had chosen the wrong one. A beautiful sunrise
and uninteresting country. Arrived at half-past
eight this 17th of July at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Breteuil</span>, and its
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Ange</span>, a fallen one!</p>

<p class='c010' >Doubtful meat, sulky servants, dirty floors;
windows commanding the view of a farrier’s
premises, admitting the scent of the smoking
hoofs, which since nine this morning have
accommodated themselves to red-hot shoes;
nothing to be seen but “a belvedere,” that
is, a circular seat at the top of a mound, which
having climbed, we may look at the road
we have travelled. Starved with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
semblance of a dinner, disgusted with the stairs
which act as fowl-house, and some of whose
steps the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne,</span> to prove her cleanliness,
scraped with a dinner knife! Walked out,
weary of the farrier, the two comrades who
assist, and the boy who dusts the flies away,
and were driven back by the still dirtier
town.</p>

<div class='c012'><span class='small'>18th July.</span></div>
<p class='c011' >One of the pleasures of travelling consists in
leaving obnoxious places. Quitted <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Breteuil</span>
at four, in a fog cold as December; passing
the Abbey, an old building with turrets and
Gothic windows, and a grove whose alleys
might have proved a resource, had we known
they were so near yesterday. Long hills, but
no view; till a short distance from Clermont,
below the road to the right, we looked down
on a wooded country, and the town, built on its
bold hill, appeared before us; and we continued
to skirt a pretty valley, passing chateaux
and pleasure grounds, till, by a gentle ascent,
we arrived at the Croissant, really a very
good inn, and after <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Breteuil</span>, a paradise.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
Fed a puppy, and Fanny showed symptoms
of a jealous disposition. D—— arrived just
in time to save his life, as she had taken him
in her mouth, and was shaking him by the
skin of his back. The heat kept us within
doors till evening, when we climbed the remainder
of the hill. Passed the place and the
church to the chateau, which is now a penitentiary,
containing 1500 women, and was
in early days a fortress of the Franks, to
protect them from Norman invasion; and
in Charles the Sixth’s time a stronghold of
the English. French guide-books still call
it a Gothic castle, though I could see no trace
of Gothic architecture remaining, except in
the building on the place now the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de
Ville</span>, which has still the vestiges of battlements,
and one old tower. The road leads,
beneath an ancient arch, to the public promenade
which surrounds the chateau which
crowns it, like a verdant belt, its fine trees
making, in French taste, stars and circles.
The view it commands, as it juts over the
valley, is very lovely; as the river shines
below, and seems to lose itself winding among
wooded hills, which succeed each other far to
the right. The townspeople were assembled
on the terrace, playing rackets with much noise
and small skill; we sat on one of the stone
benches watching the game, and the sun
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
set—decidedly we prefer setting to rising suns;
D——, in particular, has no taste for the
beauties of nature at half-past four.</p>

<p class='c010' >Left at five: passing on our way <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Creil</span> on
the Oise, looking from the bridge towards
the west, you see built, in a rather elevated
situation, the village of Montataire. It is
said that here Peter the Hermit first preached
the crusade. The ruined castle on the
island of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Creil</span> was built in Charles the Fifth
of France’s time, and a kind of balcony with
iron gates, which belonged to Charles the
Sixth’s apartment, was formerly shown. He
was confined here during his madness, and the
well built in the centre of the floor for heating
the rooms with charcoal (for chimneys
were not yet in use) remained also. I do not
know whether they exist now.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is a romantically situated town, and the
view back to it, from the hill beyond, very
interesting. Thence a straight road leads to
Chantilly, and is wearisome enough, though
a great part of it skirts the forest; but the
trees here are young, and mostly oak, and
yet without shade or beauty. A long descent
conducts to the miserable town, and we
stopped at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Bourbon Condé</span>, the
best and very bad, to breakfast and dine, intending
to go on at sunset. I came here long
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
ago to see the over ornamented park, and the
stables for 240 horses; but to-day, instead
of braving the burning sun, I lay down
tired at last with early hours, and read
a savage selection from discoveries in savage
islands. John arrived, brought by the pity
of the conductor, joined to the price of his
place, of course. There being no room, he
had constructed a pyramid of baggage on his
back, preparatory to walking, when the conductor
perched him in some unknown corner.
He is growing troublesome; complaining yesterday
of dining on bones, which on inquiry
proved two fricasseed fowls! and anxious to
know the punishment when a foreigner fights
a Frenchman. We started after a dear dinner
of bad meat, at the same time with the diligence,
whose passengers we astonished, because,
having taken the horses along a pathway
and off the high road, our only way to return
was over a ditch, which was narrow, but
excited great shouting notwithstanding. The
road through the forest pretty, but after
quitting it, shorn of all its fine trees—got
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Écouen</span> very warm and thirsty—drank some
beer in the street, and looked as we passed at
the old chateau, 400 years the property of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>. Henry, marshal of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>,
was its last owner of the name.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
His history is so interesting, that I am
tempted to write some of its circumstances
here.</p>

<p class='c010' >The war-cry of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> was “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu
aide au premier baron Chrétien,</span>” for the first
baron was (tradition tells) baptized at the
same time with Clovis, the first Christian
king. The last, who was beheaded in 1632
and left no heir, was born in 1595. An astrologer
drew his horoscope, and predicted
that he would outshine his ancestors in glory,
if he could avoid a danger which threatened
his thirty-eighth year. He is described as
being from his childhood mild, brave, and beautiful;
possessing those graces of exterior which
set off noble qualities. Henry the Fourth loved
him as his own son; and taking pleasure in
talking with the boy, he one day asked, “What
is the virtue best fitted to a monarch?” “Clemency,”
said the child; “since only kings have
privilege to pardon.” He was thirteen when
Henry bestowed on him the survivance of the
governorship of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span> possessed by his
father, who conducted him there, and himself
installed him in his dignities; but when he
had placed him in the seat the governor
occupied in the parliament of Toulouse, a
sudden presentiment of evil came over him,
and he burst into tears. The king was sad
without the boy, and soon recalled him to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
court, and proposed his marriage with his own
daughter by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Henriette d’Entragues.</span> The constable
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> had fixed his wishes
on his son’s union with Mademoiselle de
Beaufort, Henry’s daughter also, but by
Gabrielle d’Estrées, and more beloved by
him, as well as more beautiful; and the King,
irritated by opposition, exiled him to Chantilly.
He was there and in disgrace, when
a marriage with the rich <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselle de Chemilly</span>
was proposed to him for his heir.
Thinking the King might disapprove, he
desired his brother would conduct the youth
to one of his own mansions, that he might
there meet his destined bride; but Henry the
Fourth, apprized of what was passing, sent
an order to Duplessis, the commandant at
Saumur, to arrest there, on their way, the
Duke d’Amville and the young governor.
Duplessis in consequence called upon them,
and the Duke, suspecting his errand, invited
him to dine. The officer refused, yet, wishing
to do his duty civilly, put off the arrest
till after dinner, merely placing a sentinel at
the gates, intending to return in an hour or
two. D’Amville and his nephew, instead of
repairing to the eating-hall, walked straight
to the stables, and riding out a private way,
joined an escort of fifty gentlemen. When
the King knew he had been outwitted, he sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
the Duke of Soubise, with two companies of
the guards, to the house where the marriage
was to take place, with orders (if necessary) to
force an entrance, and bring away Mademoiselle
de Chemilly, but Soubise, on arriving,
found them united. Some time after, the Constable,
finding his daughter-in-law less rich
than he expected, determined on dissolving
this very marriage. The King gave his assent,
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> was neither old enough
nor sufficiently in love to resist him. Many
thought that this violation of his vow brought
on him the disasters of his after-life. Henry,
rather than disoblige his favourite, broke a
former engagement made for Mademoiselle
de Beaufort, and her marriage with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>
was about to take place in 1610,
when the King was murdered. The Duke
was yet only fifteen. Three years after he was
created Lord High Admiral, and the queen-mother
proposed his union with the Princess
Orsini, her relation, for Mademoiselle de Beaufort’s
consequence had died with her father.
The young Duke was disinclined to this
marriage, for in his own <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span> he had
fallen in love with a lady so surpassingly
lovely, that for her sake he was ready to
forget ambition and make her his wife. She
had been married to an old man, who, shortly
after <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> first saw her, slipped as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
feebly descended some steps, and died of the
blow received on his head. The Duke, who
witnessed this awful death, first consoled
and then loved the widow: but overruled by
his father, and perhaps influenced by all this
high alliance promised him, he quitted <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span>
for Paris, accompanied by a hundred
gentlemen and nobles of his province.
He was lodged in the Louvre, and married
there with all the ceremonial which accompanies
the wedding of a prince; but either
because his heart was far away with the fair
lady of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montroux,</span> or because something
whispered that out of this ill-starred union
would grow all his future misfortune, his joy
was ill feigned. There was even an unwonted
bitterness in his manner which brought on him
a foolish quarrel; for, presenting to the Duke
of Retz (who had espoused his deserted bride,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madlle. de Chemilly</span>) a bowl of sweetmeats,
which he had himself tasted, he said, “Take
these, Sir; it is not the first time you have
accepted what I have left;” they fought in
consequence, but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> disarmed him.
The Duchess Mary of Orsini was gentle and
of a fine figure, but by no means handsome.
In spite of his infidelity, which she knew and
deplored the more, seeing its object so beautiful,
she was fondly attached to her husband
and gained his esteem and affection by her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
uncomplaining gentleness. Once he remarked
with sorrow, that she looked pale and changed.
“It is true that my countenance is so,” she
replied mildly, “it must suffice you that my
heart is not.” His history would occupy too
much space if told in detail. For many years
almost constantly successful in the civil wars
which desolated France; a faithful as well as
brave subject; notwithstanding that the Cardinal
Richelieu and the Duke of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Luynes</span>
were his enemies, he refused to join the
queen-mother against the King when they
parted in anger. He was called the “King
of Men” by his soldiers, who adored him. Sent
to command the naval attack of La Rochelle,
he was denied the needful supplies through
the influence of Richelieu, and spent, to procure
them, a part of his private fortune. He
found the Dutch Admiral Houstain had lost a
vessel, and wanted munition, and furnished
him with both; yet when, having succeeded
gloriously, he returned to court, he was coldly
received by Louis the Thirteenth, and the
jealous Cardinal soon after caused the suppression
of the post of Lord High Admiral.</p>

<p class='c010' >The religious wars ended, the King sent an
army into Italy to support the Duke of Mantua
against the Austrians. Richelieu had the command,
and rather than not serve, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>
went as volunteer. The King bestowed on him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
shortly after, the command of his army at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pignerol;</span> then sent him to head the troops
which entered Piedmont, where he obtained a
signal victory. His army had received orders
to join that of Marshal Laforce, but the
Duke of Savoy lay between. The latter commenced
the attack in an unexpected quarter,
and the Marquis of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Effiat</span> and others advised
rather to sacrifice the one regiment in peril than
to risk the army. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> exclaimed,
“Who love me, follow!” and rushed forward
at the head of the King’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens-d’armes.</span> Prince
Doria was approaching; and the duke, to meet
him with less delay, and well mounted, leaped
a broad ditch which lay between them, and,
though unfollowed, forced his way before a
regiment of infantry, whose fire did not stop
him, and through the ranks of a squadron
commanded by Prince Doria, whom he
wounded; and had arrived fighting and unharmed
in the sixth rank of these horsemen
before he was joined by any of those who had
made a detour instead of leaping after him,
and who, having believed him dead, found
that he alone had half routed a squadron. By
this and other exploits, continued throughout
the day, the battle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Veillane</span> was won; and the
generous duke, who among his prisoners had
taken almost all the officers of the Piedmontese
army, sent them back to the Duchess of Savoy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
who was King Louis’s sister. He had received
no wound, but came from the field, the gold
ornaments hacked from his splendid armour,
and himself so bruised that he was hardly to
be recognised. His horse, which was called
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Remberge,</span>” was wounded in twenty
places, though slightly; and as it was a strong
and beautiful animal, one of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency’s</span>
officers wished for and received him from his
general.</p>

<p class='c010' >His troops were attacked at Rivoli by the
plague, and to aid sick friends and soldiers he
sold luxuries and comforts, and his head-quarters,
far from being kept free from infection,
rather resembled an hospital. Spite of his
successes and the love of his army, or rather
on account of them (for Richelieu envied his
popularity, and already meditated his ruin), he
was recalled. The soldiers mourned over him.
“Who,” they said, “will lead us to victory
when we lose <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>?” And yet, when
the duke arrived at Lyons, and found there
the King to all appearance dying, and Richelieu
torn by anxiety, he took pity on the
latter and frankly offered him protection in the
province he commanded: relays were held in
readiness to bear the Cardinal thither in case
of the fatal termination of Louis’s malady; he
vowed eternal gratitude, but forgot it as the
King recovered. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> had yielded
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
his assent to the suppression of the States of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span>,—a loss of privilege which the
province deplored, and he too repented. The
King at his request promised their re-establishment,
but avoided keeping his word; and
the duke, whose ambition was to hold, like so
many of his ancestors, the office of constable of
France, being only created marshal, and otherwise
coldly treated at court, retired to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span>.
The Duke of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Angoulême,</span> his brother-in-law,
said, when he bade him farewell,
“that the king could never forget his services,
and that his friends would always have sufficient
influence to efface the false impressions
made by the Cardinal;” but the duke shook
his head sadly. “I do not flatter myself,” he
said; “I shall not return to court, if affairs
there continue as at present; my welfare is
in the hands of God.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Retired to the seat of his government, the
duke’s heart was set on recovering the privileges
of the province. By the King’s command
the subject occupied the states-general
assembled at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pézenas,</span> but the King’s commissaries,
Miron and Hemery, had the Cardinal’s
private instructions to yield in nothing, for he
hoped to wear out the patience of the governor
by oppression of the province. He knew by
his spies that the King’s brother Gaston
intended striving to win over <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
and as it was his maxim to treat as guilty
those who possibly might become so, he dispatched
an order to Hemery to arrest the
duke. The latter just then making a journey
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montpellier,</span> Hemery and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marquis des
Fossés</span> followed, intending to make him prisoner
there; but they judged the people’s
love for him would render it impossible.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Fossés</span> altered his opinion when he found
he was to attend the representation of a
drama acted in his honour by the Jesuits’
pupils. He placed soldiers at the college
gates to seize him, and issued an order to
the garrison of the citadel, which joined it, to
remain under arms. The duke, warned of
what was passing, at first would not believe it
possible, but the report spreading, persons of
rank and condition flocked round him, offering
to seize Hemery and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Fossés,</span> and to
take possession of the citadel, which would
have been easy, as it was feebly garrisoned,
but the duke refused; a proof he did not
then contemplate the treason to which Richelieu’s
injustice was urging him. He went,
contrary to advice, to the college, and returned,
none having dared molest him, and two days
after returned to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pézenas,</span> where he told what
had happened to the duchess, and his uncle,
and other private counsellors there; they were
loud in their cry for vengeance. The bishop
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alby,</span> who was with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>, had a
nephew, partizan of Gaston and the queen-mother,
with whom he corresponded. Just
about this time a new commission arrived from
court empowered to tax the province, and
Alby and his nephew, who had come in disguise
to treat with the governor, took advantage
of it to influence him. They reminded him
of reward denied and services forgotten; of
the death of his cousin <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Bouteville;</span> the
refusal to restore the privileges of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span>;
the execution of the innocent Marshal of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marillac;</span> yet all would have failed, had not
the duchess joined to persuade, for she was
niece of the queen-mother. A young girl
who served her overheard a conversation
between them. The duchess spoke low, in
sentences broken by sobs; and the duke at
last answered: “I will do so; you need persuade
me no longer, your ambition shall be
satisfied: but remember it will cost me
my life.” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soud’heilles,</span> the captain of his
guard, was then in Paris; and the cardinal,
alarmed when the duke had declared himself,
dispatched him to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span> to try his
influence with his master. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>
wavered, but the duchess and his confidants
persuaded him, that to desert Gaston would
be dishonour. He had a final conference with
them, and returned from it straight to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soud’heilles.</span> “My dear friend,” he said, “the
stone is thrown, I cannot call it back again.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The weak Gaston, then, as afterwards, incapable
of opposing a foe as of protecting a
friend long, was ill advised at this juncture,
and arrived before the time agreed on with
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>, and before his measures could
be taken. He had fifteen hundred half-armed
men, the sympathy of the people, but neither
Narbonne nor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montpellier</span>. Lodeve received
him, and from thence he sent a messenger to
the duke.</p>

<p class='c010' >“He has advisers who betray him,” he said,
“and his over haste impairs his cause: but
be it so, we must face the storm; and I feel it
will fall on me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >On the way to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaucaire</span>, which opposed
Gaston, the duke passed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montpellier</span>, and the
people came out, weeping as they understood
his danger. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaucaire</span> would have been taken;
but when the army was before it, the Duke of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elbeuf</span> claimed the chief command, which had
been promised <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>; and Gaston being
undecided, as usual, the delay of the attack
gave time for the king’s troops to come up.
He soon after, through the treason of some of
his advisers, lost St. Felix de Carmain, and
when the news of its surrender reached the
prince, there came with it that of the advance
of the royal troops to take <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Castelnaudary</span>; near
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
which lay his forces. The duke disposed his
army in order of battle, near a brick bridge,
which crossed the road, half a league from the
town. “The time of your triumph is come,”
he said to Gaston; “but this sword,” touching
his own, “must be red to the hilt first.”
The prince coldly answered, “Your <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rodomontades</span>
are never ending, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Montmorency</span>,
but as yet, when you have promised
me success, I have only been indebted to you
for hope.” “I am not sorry to say to you
now, that it will always be easy for me to make
my peace with the King, and with two or
three more to retire.” In consequence of this,
high words ensued between the duke and
Gaston, and they parted hardly reconciled.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was a subject of emulation between the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Moret</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> to strike
the first blow in the battle; and the latter, to
make sure of himself doing so, asserted, as he
advanced precipitately, that he went only to
reconnoitre a post, and with some impatience
commanded the noblemen who followed him
to keep back! The Comte de Rieux, who
rode close, reminded him, that it was his duty
to be prudent, as on the general’s fate hung
the army’s. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> knew him for a
brave man, yet he said what was far from his
thoughts, “It would seem you are afraid;”
and to shorten remonstrance as well as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
distance, he leaped his horse, as at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Viellane</span>,
across a broad fence, and found himself at the
other side with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de la Feuillade,</span> the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vicomte du Pujol Villeneuve,</span> and a few
more, in the midst of the enemy’s infantry. At
the first fire, all with him fell, except Pujol,
who fought by his side till a shot in the leg
disabled him. His company of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens-d’armes</span>
came up, but the infantry, posted to advantage,
kept up a fire which few escaped; yet
the duke was unshaken; he opened a way
wherever he turned, and might have retired
with ease, and gloriously, to bring up the
army; but being within their sight, he believed
the troops would advance to support
him; and a corps of cavalry, commanded by
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron de Laurières,</span> coming up, he spurred so
impetuously to meet him, that horse and man,
as he encountered them, went down; and discharged
on the head-piece of the leader’s son,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron de Bourdet,</span> so violent a blow, that the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casque,</span> examined after the battle, seemed indented
by a battle-axe rather than a sword.
His father rose from the ground at the moment,
and seeing his son stagger, he wounded
mortally the duke’s charger, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>
fell with and under his dying horse. If
Gaston had then brought up the army, this
misfortune might have been repaired. The
Duke of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elbeuf</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Puy Laurens,</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
Ferté Imbaut,</span> (the two last suspected of having
been bought over,) persuaded him to hold
back, though his peril was visible from where
they stood. A report next reached the prince,
that his general had fallen, whereupon, flinging
down his arms, and panic-struck, he exclaimed,
“Sound the retreat, I will play this
game no further.”</p>

<p class='c010' >During this time <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guiltaut</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Preuil,</span>
captains of the royal guard, had come up with
the duke, and mourned over him as he was
drawn with difficulty from under his dead
horse, covered with its gore and his own, for
he was desperately wounded; and the blood
which gushed from his mouth, as he lay with
the weight pressing on him, had almost stifled
him. “I sacrificed myself to ungrateful
cowards,” he said, as soon as he could speak,
“though it was told me, even before <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaucaire</span>,
that I was betrayed in the prince’s
army.” Four soldiers raised him gently, and
carried him to Marshal Schomberg, who received
him with the esteem and tenderness
which were his due. It is told that he wore on
his arm, when taken prisoner, a portrait enriched
with diamonds; this was perceived by his
friend, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Bellièvre,</span> who was afterwards President
of the Parliament. Recognizing the female
head, he pretended to question the duke,
and taking his arm as he spoke to him, adroitly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
drew forth the miniature; but dexterously as
it was done, it could not be hidden from a spy
of the cardinal, present at the scene, and it
was reported to Richelieu, who made use of it
as a means to render Louis the Thirteenth
implacable, as the picture was that of his
queen, Anne of Austria!</p>

<p class='c010' >The Count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Moret,</span> natural son of Henry
the Fourth, received his death-wound not thirty
paces from his companion in arms. The latter, in
consequence of the refinement on cruelty practised
by the cardinal, and while all the people,
loud as they dared, murmured shame, was
borne in a litter to Toulouse, notwithstanding
the insupportable heat and his uncured
wounds. The inhabitants of Toulouse vowed
to save him at any cost, but the cardinal received
intimation of their resolves, and the
prisoner was carried through without stopping
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leitoure.</span> Arrived, he was conducted to
the castle, and here a chance of escape presented
itself again, for the Marchioness of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Castelnaud</span> bribed one of the guards, and provided
him with ropes, by which the duke might
be lowered to a place whence a passage led out
into the country; and the marchioness, who
was a determined woman, advanced with
twenty horsemen as near to the citadel as they
dared; but the guard was discovered with the
ropes in his possession, by the lieutenant of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
the citadel, and killed by him on the spot, in
the first burst of passion.</p>

<p class='c010' >Notwithstanding the prayers of the army
and the people, those of his brothers-in-law,
the Prince of Condé and Duke of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Angoulême</span>,
the agony of the duchess—the proceedings
against <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> went on, and to a
fatal termination. He expressed penitence
for his conduct, and showed as much firmness
as in his best days. He was persuaded by
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Launay</span> and his confessor to ask his pardon
of the king: “Tell the cardinal,” he added
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Launay,</span> charged with the message, “that
if he saves my life, he will have no reason to
repent of it: but also that I do not ask the
king’s council to act against conviction, if they
believe my death more useful to the state
than might be the rest of the years I have
to live.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Anne of Austria, the queen consort, solicited
by the Duke of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Épernon</span> and the principal nobility
of the court, to intercede with the king,
feared the cardinal’s misinterpretation, and applied
to him in the first instance. He answered
that he did not doubt the king’s granting
any favour she desired, but that she herself
should also consider, that the annoyance
she was about to cause him would injure his
health, which, since his malady at Lyons, he
had never recovered; and Anne, seeing by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
cardinal’s manner, that, by saving the captive
she risked his anger, determined rather to let
him die. The people assembled under the
king’s windows, and their cry reached his ears:
he asked its import, it was “Mercy for
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>!” The king merely permitted
him to dispose of his property, notwithstanding
the confiscation about to be pronounced, and
the duke occupied himself with the payment
of his debts and the care of his vassals. He
wrote an affectionate farewell to his unhappy
wife, who was not in a state to read it, and
sent to Richelieu, who had once wished to possess
it, a fine picture of St. Sebastian, as his
dying gift.</p>

<p class='c010' >The last night of his existence he slept
during six hours, tranquilly, as if the coming
events of the next day were unknown to him,
and prayed fervently when he woke. The hour
arrived for his being conducted to the palace,
he received the Count of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charlus</span>, who came
to seek him, cheerfully as ever, but refused to
allow his surgeon to dress his wounds, saying
they would soon be cured. He asked for
something to eat, and then got into the carriage,
which was open. The Counts of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charlus</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Launay</span> followed, and four companies
of soldiers escorted him; the rest of the army
lined the streets he passed through, or filled
the squares of the town. As he stood with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
mild demeanour and bareheaded before his
judges, his noble presence was that of the
governor, not the criminal. The judges seeing
him they loved, and were perforce about to
doom, looked down to hide the tears which
rose in spite of them, or buried their faces in
their handkerchiefs. He was desired to sit on
the criminal’s stool, which however, contrary
to custom, had been raised to the level of the
judges’ seats, and, contrary to custom also, he
was left unbound. He was painfully affected
while replying to the question, “Whether he
had children by his marriage,” for he mourned
the want of an heir.</p>

<p class='c010' >The trial over, he was conducted from the
Palace of Justice back to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span>,
where he recommenced his devotions, and these
ended, conversed with his friends and wrote
some private instructions for his family; and
the Count de <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charlus</span>, his face covered with
tears, asking in the king’s name for his order
of the Holy Ghost and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bâton</span> of marshal, he
delivered them calmly, saying, “it was true
that one crime had cancelled the services which
obtained them;” and then took some slight
refreshment. He next repaired to the chapel.
The commissaries of the court arrived to read
his sentence to him, he listened with perfect
tranquillity, kneeling before the altar, and
rising when they concluded, and sobbed with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
their emotion, he spoke to them with great
kindness. He was informed that the royal
favour (though indeed it was the cardinal’s
fear) allowed his being executed within the
courts of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span> instead of on the
public square. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Launay</span> was at this time
with the king, who had sent for him, and the
duke’s friends felt hope revive; but Louis
merely desired “that he should die unbound,”
and this he declined, saying, “he would end
life as he deserved, like a criminal.” He cut
off his own hair, and changed his rich attire
for the poor clothes of a soldier; he had
bowed, as he came along, to the troops who
guarded him, and bade them farewell. There
was some delay, (perhaps in consequence of
changing the place of execution,) and during
this time the duke remained seated on a bench
adjoining the chapel balustrade, and conversed
with his confessor, too low for others to
overhear. He asked for water to wash his
mouth, for he suffered from sore throat: “Father,”
he said, “can you explain to me my
feelings? Before heaven I assure you that I
go to death with satisfaction, without regret
or dread; and if I had never believed in God
until now, this firmness vouchsafed to my
weak nature would make me adore him.”
Efforts, even in this last hour, were made to
save him, but in vain, though the Pope’s nuncio
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
was one who pleaded. He calmly presented
his arms to be bound by the executioner,
and desired Father <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arnoux</span> to take
from his hand the crucifix, since “the just
might not be bound with the guilty.” He
was led into the court where was the scaffold,
and his surgeon cut his hair which he had left
too long, and fainted when he had done; even
the executioner wept. The marble statue of
Henry the Fourth stood above one of the
entrances, and he gazed at it earnestly. The
confessor noticing it, he said, “Father, he
was a good and generous prince.” Continuing
to advance, he ascended the steps of the
scaffold as firmly as if they had led to glory.
He spoke to a jesuit who stood beneath: “I
pray you,” he said, “prevent, if you may,
my head from falling to the earth; receive it,
if possible.” He kneeled and prayed once
more, and adjusted himself on the block,
which gave him great pain, as it was too low;
a single stroke severed his head from his body.
The gates were thrown open; people and
troops thronged in with cries of grief, crowding
round and on the scaffold, reverently
dipping kerchiefs in his blood, which they
held to be that of a martyr. That day, a
soldier drew on the executioner to kill the
wretch by whose vile hand the best and bravest
of men had died. The people withheld and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
concealed him, for the cardinal caused search
to be made that he might be put to death.
His hatred was not quenched in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency’s</span>
blood, for he persecuted his friends
and relatives.</p>

<p class='c010' >After the execution, the duke’s body was
folded in a black silk velvet pall, and conveyed
in a carriage to the abbey of St. Sernin,
where it was buried in a chapel in which only
the bones of saints had been laid, and the
counts of Toulouse had been refused a sepulchre.
Masses for the repose of his soul were
said in every part of France, as well as by the
command of the empress at Vienna, and the
arch-duchess in the Low Countries. The king
imprisoned the unhappy widow in the castle
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulins,</span> where she remained eight months
reproaching herself with her husband’s untimely
death; but feeling that time elapsed,
that there could be no reason for doubting
her, and ashamed of his rigour, he desired her
to choose her place of residence, either within
or without his kingdom; she staid at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulins.</span>
Having purchased a house adjoining the convent
of La Visitation, she there lived an exemplary
life during ten years, her only consolation
a portrait of the duke, gazing on
which she spent whole days. Before her
marriage she had wished to become a nun,
and the desire now reviving, in her mistaken
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
fervour, she believed it a duty to part with
this which she looked on as a last tie to the
world, and ere she entered the convent she
wept over it once more and then parted from
it.</p>

<p class='c010' >Some time after, the king passing through
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulins,</span> did her the honour of a visit, and the
next day the cardinal sent to offer her his
compliments. In her cell hung with black,
the shadow of what she had been, the duchess
received his officer: “Tell your master,” she
said, “that I thank him, but that my tears
are still undried!” After his general’s death,
the king’s remorse was awakened; and he
confessed that he repented of many things
which had been done during his inauspicious
journey to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Languedoc</span>. He once arrived late
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Écouen</span>, intending to pass the night there.
It was evening, and the monarch passed slowly
along one of the vast halls on his way to the
apartment prepared for him. His suite followed
at a little distance, but rushed to his
side when he uttered a faint cry, and stretched
his arm forth in the gloom as if to put back
some one advancing on him.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What ails you, sire,” they exclaimed as
he stood still, and in an attitude of defence
against what appeared to them empty space.
“He was there! I saw <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span> there,”
said the king; “I cannot sleep in this castle;”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
and turning precipitately, Louis the Thirteenth
left the hall. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Écouen</span> now again, as during
the empire, belongs to the Legion of Honour.
As we rode down the hill, the fine view of
Paris once more stretched below us in the sunshine.
I had not seen it for some years, and
looked at it now with a strange sensation,
pleasant and painful, for it seemed like home,
because so much of early association is connected
with it, and I felt it was not home, because
death and marriage, time and revolution
have so severed and scattered all the links
which held me here, that I shall scarcely find
a trace of where they were once riveted.</p>

<p class='c010' >From <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Écouen</span> to St. Denis the way seemed
wearisome, for we had ridden fifteen leagues
since morning, yet Fanny went prancing into
the inn yard gay as at starting. A disagreeable
hotel from its unconquerable bad air.
To-day, 19th July, D—— is gone to Paris
in search of apartments; and I, followed by
John, have passed an hour in the cathedral.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span>, I believe, thought his countenance
suspicious, for he was unwilling to lead
the way. Near the principal entrance, on
the left hand, is a strange monument, erected
by St. Louis to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dagobert</span>. This church (my
authority is the Benedictine who wrote its history)
was founded under singular circumstances.
When <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clotaire</span> the Second was king
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
its place was occupied by a small chapel, which
had already miraculous properties, being
built over St. Denis’s tomb. A stag, hard
pressed, had one day taken refuge within, and
the hounds were unable to follow. Prince
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dagobert</span> witnessed this fact. He soon after
incurred his father’s anger by barbarously ill-treating
his governor, and he repaired to the
sanctuary. The royal guards sent to seize
him were invisibly withheld, and the prince
fell asleep while they rushed to and fro, vainly
attempting to come nearer. St. Denis appeared
to him in a dream, and desired that he would
erect a building in his honour. Become king
he obeyed the saint’s mandate; and when the
day for the consecration of the church came
(the 24th February, 636), and a great crowd
assembled to witness it, the people were all
forced to retire, excepting one poor leper, who
hid himself in a corner of the chapel. Night
closed in, and of a sudden he beheld a great
light shining through one of the windows, filling
the whole church; and continuing to fix his
eyes on the same window, he saw the Saviour
enter at it, followed by St. Peter and St. Paul,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Rustique</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Éleuthère,</span> and also by a
great multitude of saints and angels. He
consecrated the church, walked round it, heading
the procession, scattered holy water on the
pavement, poured celestial oil on the walls,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
and at last perceived the leper: he commanded
him to tell faithfully what he had seen to king
and prelate. “Alas!” said the leper, “I
cannot approach them for my rags and my
leprosy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >He had no sooner said this, than he felt the
skin of his face gently lifted, and being cast
against the wall it stuck there, and that which
remained in its place was pure as a child’s;
and looking at his clothes he saw he was
richly habited: this miracle performed, he
watched the Saviour and the celestial procession
issue forth by the same window, and went
and told the king.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010' >More interesting than <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dagobert’s</span> tomb, or
those of Louis the Twelfth, and Anne of Brittany,
and Henry the Second, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catherine de
Médicis,</span> with her countenance telling of a life
of intrigue, public massacre and private murder,
is the slight marble column, at whose
foot are three weeping angels,—for it was
raised by Mary of Scotland to the memory of
her young husband, who died when she had
been a wife and queen of France but one short
year. The monument of Francis the First is
in the opposite aisle; the figures of himself and
his wife Anne, kneeling on the top of the stone
canopy, under which they are again represented
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
dead. The alto relievo of the battle
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marignan</span>, which surrounds the tomb, is
very beautiful. On each side of the choir
steps lead down to the crypt, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span>
unlocked the iron gate, though still I saw
against his will, and we walked through the
avenue of royal tombstones, wherein kings and
queens do not sleep now; since a municipal
decree, proceeding from St. Denis itself, in
conformity with the decree of the Convention,
ordered on the 12th of October, 1793, the
breaking open of the monuments for the sake
of the lead they might contain, and the scattering
of bones, some of which had lain there
near 1500 years. Curiosity induced the
workmen to commence by the grave of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Turenne</span>.
He was found in an extraordinary state
of preservation, perfectly resembling the portraits
and medals which we possess of him,
only that the skin had darkened. The distortion
of feature, caused by his violent death
(by a cannon ball), remained, as the mouth
was very wide open. He was, at the suggestion
of some present, confided to one “Host,”
keeper of the cathedral, and by him placed in
an oaken case with a glass cover, and for eight
months exhibited in the vestry. The vault of
the Bourbons and the tomb of Henry the
Fourth were next opened, and the body found
so perfect, that the features had undergone no
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
change. He also was exhibited during the
two following days, and then borne to the
churchyard, called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Valois</span>, where he was
buried in a grave dug at its extremity, on
the right hand and north side. A soldier present
at the time rushed towards the corpse,
and with his sabre cut from it a lock of the
long beard, exclaiming, that “He too was a
Frenchman,” and henceforth would wear no
other <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">mustachio;</span> and holding the lock on his
upper lip, and saying he was sure of conquering
any enemy of France, went away.</p>

<p class='c010' >The remainder of the bodies, some in a
state of putrefaction, which during this unnatural
work produced malignant fever,
others, reduced to skeletons or ashes, were
dragged from their coffins, and flung by torchlight
into one wide grave. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> pointed
out the side door near Mary Stuart’s funeral
column, as that through which they were
carried. The monuments in the crypt are
ranged in chronological order: among the
most ancient, those of the royal fury <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frédégonde</span>
and her daughter-in-law <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brunehaude,</span>
who died torn by wild horses. The vaults are
but half under ground, and a dreary daylight
enters, falling on the figures stretched on the
tombs, for those only of the earliest period are
mere outlines. The rest are dressed in the
costume of their time, with hands crossed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
raised, and the dog or lion couched at the
feet. “Here,” said the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span>, stopping
before one of the Capetian race, and pointing
to the very prominent nose which had been
broken from his face and lay there yet uncemented,
“is the token of the last English
visit. A gentleman came, conversed with me,
walked by my side, and when he thought
me not attending to his movements, wrenched
off this nose. I seized it in his hand in his
coat pocket; he said he had broken it by mistake,
and pocketed it in absence of mind.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon pauvre nez, que je n’ai pas encore restitué,</span>”
said the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> in indignation. I understood
at last why he had an objection to
showing the church, and tranquillized him by
making John walk on before. Here were laid
Clovis, the first Christian king, and his wife,
Bertha, who converted him; King John after
his ill-fortune at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poitiers;</span> his excursion on his
white horse through the streets of London, beside
his conqueror, on his pony; his visit to his
own kingdom, and voluntary return to captivity
to die.</p>

<p class='c010' >We wished to enter the vault where the
Bourbons are interred, but this the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</span> said
was impossible, as he had not the keys, and
even <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons. Thiers</span> had been denied admittance
some days before. The last buried was Louis
the Eighteenth, whose <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapelle ardente</span> I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
here when I was a child, and with its splendid
sarcophagus, purple velvet hangings, and
thousand lights, and the silent crowd pressing
to see, was a scene of melancholy brilliancy.
The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapelle ardente</span>” occupied
the whole of the nave, inclosed by the hangings,
and terminated by a burning cross.</p>

<p class='c010' >The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caveau,</span>” which holds the last <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Condé,</span>
is totally dark, excepting where the lamp,
which burns so feebly in its bad air, just shows
the damp-decaying pall hanging in ribands.
The lapse of centuries robs in some measure
of its sadness the long range of monuments we
passed before; but it is not so as we look
through the iron gate at these dimly-seen
coffins.</p>

<p class='c010' >We think of the ditch of Vincennes and the
bed-room of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Leu!</span></p>

<p class='c010' >It was in the now-closed vault of the Bourbons
that Henry the Fourth lay. One anecdote
more I must tell you, as it proves the
respect entertained for his memory. It is told
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Noir,</span> the antiquarian:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“The day following that of the allied
armies’ entrance into Paris, a Russian general,
accompanied by a detachment of cavalry, presented
himself at eight in the morning at the
museum of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petits Augustins.</span> He said
he had heard in Russia of the collection I
had formed, and as a lover of the arts it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
the first place he desired to visit in Paris. I
opened the gates to him, and he and his soldiers
dismounted. Arrived in the hall of the
sixteenth century, a statue in white marble
absorbed his attention. I said to him, ‘It is
the statue of Henry the Fourth.’ He repeated
my words in Russian to his companions, and all,
uncovering their heads, kneeled on one knee to
do homage to the dead king of France.”</p>

<p class='c010' >In January, 1815, the remains of Louis the
Sixteenth and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie Antoinette</span> were transferred
to the vault of the Bourbons. In 1817, all
the noble or royal remains cast forth from the
violated tombs were once more deposited within
them in presence of the chancellor, the necessary
authorities and witnesses, a company of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> and the clergy of St.
Denis. Immense crowds flocked thither, by a
bright moonlight which shone on the old
towers, making the numberless torches which
flashed on the walls almost useless; the broken
and mingled bones were returned to their
first place of repose, after a twenty-four years’
exile.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Cathedral of St. Denis will shortly be
in complete repair, though it was ravaged in
the revolution, and roofless during twelve
years; though it was several times offered for
sale without finding a purchaser; and its
destruction had been commanded, when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
Radel, architecte des domaines,</span> proposed, with
a view to preserve it, that it should be left
as it stood then, with uncovered walls, and
rain, or snow, falling in its aisles, and serve
as a kind of market-house in the fairs which
occur frequently during the year!</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>Paris, and in our old apartment, 20th of July.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Unforeseen circumstances have postponed
till next spring our ride to Italy, when I will
continue these notes for you, and we shall go
as heretofore, except that John will no longer
be of the party; his disposition has become so
warlike that we intend sending him back to
Ireland.</p>

<div class='c009'><span class='small'>April 5th, 1839.</span></div>
<p class='c011' >Set forth once more on the second, under an
unlucky star, for the rain commenced as we
passed the barrier, and having received it on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
our heads during a walk of four hours, (for over
the broken pavement, or through the three-foot-thick
mud at its sides it was impossible
to trot,) we were glad to take refuge in a
wretched <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span> at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essonne</span>. I think I
mentioned to you “a country inn” in England
where we stopped, tempted by its quiet
appearance, and charmed by the brilliantly
white curtains of the tiny bed-room: but alas!
the farmers were returning from Tewkesbury
fair, and they drank and sang in the kitchen
below. We rejoiced that this could not pass
a certain hour, but they had smoked, and the
fumes of tobacco rose to our room through the
chinks of the floor, and there being no chimney
could not get out again; then the family put
the house to rights; then we heard the horses
kick all night, there being in the shed next
theirs pigs, with whom they would not fraternize;
and the rats galloped to and fro, and squeaked
at our very pillows, and when these were quiet,
at dawn up rose mine host and hostess, and the
maid of all work to scour the house from top
to bottom, and run about it in pattens. All
this is comfort, compared to a country <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span>
in France. Arriving wet and weary, to stand in
the middle of a great brick-floored room, in
which there has been no fire all the winter, in
expectation of seeing damp faggots burn; and
finding when they do that the door into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
corridor must be left wide open, that the
draught may conduct towards the chimney
the smoke, and the steam of wet clothes and
damp sheets which must be dried there, as
the economical kitchen hearth exhibits only
a few dying embers,—this was our case. The
good old woman to be sure offered a remedy,
as she said that we might, if we liked, take a
dry pair of sheets, which had been slept in
only once, and recommended hanging the
dripping habit and cloaks in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grenier,</span> whose
unglazed windows let in full as much rain as
wind. Add to my previous enumeration a
dinner of dry <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouilli,</span> and greasy cabbage, a
faggot for our feet serving as a rug, and
dirty alcove with plenty of cobwebs but no
curtains.</p>

<p class='c010' >I believe the descent of the road into
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essonne</span> commands a pretty view, but the
rain blinded me. We passed on the right hand
the château du <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit Bourg</span>, once the Duke
d’Antin’s, now the property of the parvenu
Spanish banker, whose collection of pictures
is the finest in Paris, and who once, history
says, kept a wine-shop on the boulevard. It
was here the Czar Peter dined on his way to
Fontainebleau, May 30th, 1700, where the
Duke <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Villeroy</span> received him; and after a
stag-hunt in the forest and a carouse in the
Pavilion <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de l’Étang,</span> it was necessary to carry
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
himself and his suite into the boats, and thence
into the carriages, which bore inebriated
majesty back to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit Bourg</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >Awaking the 3d with a cold on my chest,
and determined at least on being ill in better
quarters, set out, rain having subsided to fog:
a bad and weary road, till, two leagues from
Fontainebleau, we entered the forest, and it
looks really royal with its magnificent trees
and hills of rock: green (though spring is so
backward) with the luxuriant holly, which flourishes
everywhere, and the different coloured
bright mosses which clothe its old trunks,
and masses of strange shaped stone. Stopped at
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de France</span>, on the Place du Château
opposite the palace; a fine, frowning, old
building, looking as if sorrow and crime
might have lodged within its walls without
tales told. This inn has every possible
comfort to recommend it, and is reasonable
besides. Some of our country-people, who
formerly spoiled the road by extravagance,
now drive rather hard bargains. What do you
think of a post-carriage containing six, having
just now stopped, wanting beds, tea, and eggs
for their party for six francs?</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>April 5th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Went yesterday to see the Château, and
returned there to-day. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">surveillant</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
of yesterday gruffly turned us back, as the
Infant of Spain was expected, but admitted
us in consideration of the fee. Our guide
to-day showed the Château much more
fully, and could be prevailed on by no
entreaty to accept payment. They are
strictly enjoined to take nothing. The grand
staircase, whose entrance is in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cour du
Cheval Blanc,</span> was built in Louis the Thirteenth’s
time. The apartments on the right,
now those of the Duke and Duchess of Orleans,
and splendidly furnished on their marriage,
are the same in which the Emperor Charles
the Fifth was lodged when he visited Francis
the First in 1539; afterwards those of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catherine
de Médicis</span>, and, when she and her bloody line
had passed away, of Anne of Austria; and next
of Maria Theresa, wife of Louis the Fourteenth.
The portraits of the two last are placed above
the entrance doors of the chamber next the
saloon, which still bears the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambre
des Reines-Mères</span>. Here in this very room
was mass daily said by Pius the Seventh, during
his forced stay in 1812, in the same apartments
which had been decorated for his arrival when
he came to crown Napoleon in 1804.</p>

<p class='c010' >The most ancient as well as the most
interesting part, of the Château is the Gothic
chapel of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Saturnin.</span> Built by Louis the
Seventh in the twelfth century, and consecrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
by Thomas à Becket, archbishop of Canterbury,
to whose tomb, considering him a saint
and martyr, Louis the Seventh afterwards made
a pilgrimage, it was restored by Francis the
First, and embellished by Henry the Second.
The cyphers puzzled me; and they are indeed
strangely mingled, for those of the Saviour and
the Virgin, I and M, are placed alternately with
the H, D, those of King Henry the Second,
and his mistress Diana!</p>

<p class='c010' >The chapel is small and low, a most impressive
place: the heavy masonry looking
likely to stand till the crumbling of the world
shakes it down, and dimly lighted by three
narrow windows, whose coloured glass was
painted at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sèvres,</span> from drawings by poor
Princess Mary. The young artist beatified
the members of her family before their time.
St. Philip is an excellent likeness of the king,
made saint-like by a long beard. The superb
confessional, in carved oak, looks coeval with
the walls, but it is the recent work of a clever
Parisian artisan.</p>

<p class='c010' >The apartments now Louis Philip’s were
once Napoleon’s. The Cabinet de Travail
precedes the Emperor’s bed-room, and contains
the small plain table on which he signed
his abdication, and the fac simile of its rough
copy in his own hand, so scrawled and blotted,
I could not read a word. The bed-room is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
still furnished as it was in his time, saving the
golden eagles, which were removed on the
restoration, and are about to be replaced now.
The king occupies, not this chamber, but the
next in order, which was the unfortunate
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie Antoinette’s boudoir</span>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle du Trone</span>
which follows is also in the same state as
during the empire, except that the portrait of
Louis the Thirteenth, which hung here when this
was his bed-chamber, replaces that of Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c010' >The charming little room next it, which was
the Queen’s boudoir, would interest you, not
so much for its lovely decorations, as because
it was constructed for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie Antoinette</span> by
Louis the Sixteenth’s order; and the beautiful
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">espagnolettes</span> of the windows (up which the
delicately carved gold acanthus leaves twine on
a blue ground) were the work of the king’s own
hand. This suite of apartments looks on the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cour de l’Orangerie,</span> of which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie de
Diane</span>, and the apartments directly beneath it,
which were once the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie des Cerfs</span>, form
another side. I was most anxious to see the latter,
which is interesting as the scene of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monaldeschi’s</span>
murder, the favourite of the crowned
barbarian Christina of Sweden. It is not shown
now; it was falling into decay in the Emperor’s
time, the guide said, and by him replaced by
apartments for the King of Rome. From the
window at which we were standing, he pointed
to the one near which <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monaldeschi</span> was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
assassinated. An inscription marks it, the third
from where the gallery joins the main building.</p>

<p class='c010' >Christina abdicated the 16th of June, 1654.
She crossed France in her way to Italy. As she
was about to proceed to Paris, a command of
Louis the Fourteenth stopped her at Fontainebleau,
where she arrived the 3d of October,
1657. The following extract is from the account
given by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lebel,</span> the head of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mathurin</span>
monastery.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The 8th of November, 1657, at a quarter
past nine in the morning, the Queen of
Sweden, who was lodged in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conciergerie</span> of
the château, sent a running footman to fetch me.
He said, ‘If you are the superior of the monastery,
I have her majesty’s order to bring you
where you may have speech together.’ I replied,
I was so, and would accompany him to learn
her will; and without taking any one along
with me, fearing to make her wait, I followed
the valet to the antechamber. I was detained
there some minutes, but the valet having at
last returned, I was conducted to the Queen’s
chamber. I found her alone, and having
offered her my humble respects, I asked what
she required of her servant. She desired me
to follow her to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie des Cerfs</span>, where
we might speak undisturbed; and being entered
there, she asked whether we had ever
met before. I replied, I had merely had the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
honour of saluting her, and offering my best
services, for which her goodness thanked me.
Whereupon she said, that the robe I wore induced
her to confide in me, and desired that I
would promise to keep her secret as one under
the seal of confession. I answered, that whenever
I was intrusted with aught, I became
naturally dumb on that subject; and being
discreet with regard to the humble, I had of
course stronger reason for discretion now; and
I added, Scripture saith, ‘it is good to keep
the king’s secret.’ Having asked me this
question, she placed in my hands a packet
of papers, without superscription, but sealed
with three seals, bidding me to return it to
her in such time and presence as should be
commanded me by her majesty. She desired
also that I would take note of the day, hour,
and place in which she gave it to my care, and
without further conversation I retired with the
packet, leaving the Queen in the gallery. On
Saturday, the 10th day of the same month, at
one in the afternoon, the Queen of Sweden
again sent a valet to fetch me; whereupon I
went to a cabinet and took thence the packet,
thinking she might demand it of me. I followed
the footman, who conducted me through
the gate of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donjon</span>, and into the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie des
Cerfs</span>, and as soon as I was within, closed the
door on me with a vivacity which surprised
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
me. Perceiving about the centre of the gallery
the Queen, talking to one of her suite,
whom she called Marquis, (I afterwards knew
it was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monaldeschi</span>,) I approached her, and
she asked in a rather loud tone of voice, in
hearing of the marquis and of three men who
stood near, for ‘the papers.’ Two of these
men were some steps from her, and the third
by her side. I drew near and presented the
packet. Her majesty took and examined it
for a time, and then opening the enclosure,
gave the letters it contained to the marquis,
saying with a grave voice and commanding
manner, ‘Are not these known to you?’ He
denied that they were, but turned very pale.
‘You will not avow these,’ rejoined the
Queen, (they were in truth only copies made
by her own hand;) and having allowed him to
examine them, she next drew from under her
robe the originals, and, showing them, called
him traitor, and made him acknowledge his
writing and signature. She asked him the
same question several times, and the marquis
strove to excuse himself, and cast the blame
on others. At last he threw himself on his
knees, craving her forgiveness; and the three
men present at the same moment drew their
swords from the scabbard. He started up
again, imploring her to hear him, and drew
her as he spoke earnestly from one corner to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
another of the gallery. Her majesty did not
refuse, but listened very patiently, never showing
anger or weariness. When he pressed
her most to receive his excuses, she turned to
me, and said, ‘Bear witness, father, that I
hasten nothing against this man, but that I
give to a perfidious traitor all the time that he
requires; yea, even more, to justify himself if
possible;’ and approaching the marquis again
she leaned on the rounded head of her ebony
cane.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The Marquis of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monaldeschi</span>, hard pressed
by the Queen, gave her other papers, and
with them two or three small keys, which he
took from a pocket, whence at the same time
fell several pieces of silver. Their conference
lasted rather more than an hour, and his replies
not having satisfied her, she again walked
up to me, saying in a voice still rather loud,
but grave and calm, ‘Father, I retire, and
leave you this man; have a care of his soul,
and prepare him to die.’ If her sentence had
been pronounced against myself, I should
scarcely have felt more terror. I and the
marquis both kneeled down to implore her
pardon; she said, ‘He was more criminal than
many condemned to the wheel, and she could
not grant it;’ that, thinking him a faithful
subject, she had communicated to him her most
important affairs and secret thoughts; that she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
would not remind him of the benefits she had
conferred on him, as his conscience might serve
for tormentor, for she had favoured him
more than a brother.’ The Queen then retired,
and the marquis, left with me and the three
with their drawn swords, continued on his
knees, praying me to follow her majesty, and
strive to soften her. The men desired him to
confess, pointing their swords at his throat,
but forbearing to touch him, and I with tears
in my eyes besought him to ask pardon of
God.</p>

<p class='c010' >“He who seemed the chief of the three men,
himself taking pity on him, did indeed seek
the Queen, but returned sorrowful, and said,
weeping, ‘Marquis, think only of God, for
you must indeed die.’ The marquis, who
at the words seemed half frantic, prostrated
himself on the ground once more, and desired
that I would myself seek her, and try the effect
of my prayers. I did so, and found her alone
in her chamber, her countenance serene, and
her manner betraying no emotion. I sunk
down before her, conjuring her majesty by the
sorrows of Christ to have mercy. She said,
‘She regretted the necessity she was under to
refuse me, for, from his perfidy to her, he
could expect neither respite nor pardon.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“Finding that entreaties availed nothing, I
took the liberty of representing that she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
beneath the roof of the King of France, and
bade her beware of what she did, as he might
disapprove. She called heaven to witness
that she bore no personal hatred to the marquis,
but that she chose to punish an unparalleled
treason; that she was not lodged by the
king as one who took refuge, neither was she
a captive; and as she obeyed nought save her
own will, she chose to administer justice to her
servants at all times and in all places.</p>

<p class='c010' >“In this extremity I knew not what to resolve
on. I could not quit the château; and even
had it been in my power, I felt bound by
charity and my conscience to dispose the marquis
to die. I returned then to the gallery,
and embracing the unhappy man, who was
drowned in tears, I exhorted him to turn all
his thoughts to God and his conscience, as
there was no hope for him on earth.</p>

<p class='c010' >“At this news, having uttered two or three
melancholy cries, he kneeled down before me
as I sat on one of the benches, and commenced
his confession, which having nearly concluded,
he rose and cried aloud twice. He then ended
his confession, mingling French, Latin, and
Italian in his fear and confusion. The Queen’s
almoner at that moment entered, and the marquis,
without waiting to receive absolution,
went to him, conceiving hopes from his favour
with her majesty. They whispered apart,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
holding one another by the hand for some time,
and then the almoner went out, taking with
him the chief of the three. The latter returned
alone, and said, ‘Marquis, you must die without
more delay: have you confessed?’ Saying
this, he pressed him against the wall at
that end of the gallery where hangs the picture
of St. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Germain en Laye</span>, and I could not
so suddenly turn aside as to avoid seeing him
struck in the chest on the right side, and that
he, trying to ward off the blow, caught the
blade in his right hand, from which, as the
other drew it back, it cut off three fingers.</p>

<p class='c010' >“He then exclaimed that he wore a shirt of
mail, as in truth he did, one which weighed
nine or ten pounds, and the same man repeated
the blow, aiming it at his face, and the marquis
cried out, ‘Father, father!’ I went
to him, and the other retreated a little, and he
confessed somewhat more, and I gave him absolution,
imposing on him for penitence that
he should suffer a violent death. He threw
himself on the floor, and as he fell, one of the
men gave him a blow on the head, which
carried away part of the skull; and, being
stretched on his face, he made signs that they
should cut his throat; and they wounded him
there several times, but not mortally, because
the shirt of mail rose high under the collar of
his doublet, and deadened the blows. All this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
time I exhorted him to think of heaven, and
bear all patiently. The chief of the three
then asked me whether he should finish him,
and I answered angrily, and said, I had no
advice to give, as I had prayed not for his
death, but his life; and then he begged my
pardon, and said he was wrong to ask me such
a question.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The poor marquis, who lay expecting the
last stroke, now heard the door of the gallery
open, and recalled his courage, seeing the almoner
enter, and dragged himself towards him,
supporting himself against the wainscoting.
I was on his right hand, and the almoner passed
to his left, and the marquis, joining his hands,
said something, as if he was confessing; and
the almoner, having first asked my leave, gave
him absolution and retired, desiring me to
remain while he went to the Queen. At this
moment, the same who had wounded him in the
throat before, and who had stood by the almoner’s
side, pierced it through with a long narrow
sword, whereupon the marquis fell on his
right side, and did not speak again, but continued
to breathe yet a quarter of an hour,
during which time I exhorted him as well as I
was able. Having lost all his blood, he expired
at three quarters past three. I recited the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Profundis,</span> and the chief of the three men
moved a leg and then an arm, to see if he were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
really dead, and searched his pockets, but
found nothing, excepting a small knife and a
prayer book: we then all three departed to
receive the Queen’s orders. She said she regretted
having been forced to command his
execution; but that she had done justice, and
prayed heaven to pardon him. She desired
me to see that his corpse was carried away
and buried, and that masses were said for the
repose of his soul. I had a coffin made, and
because of the darkness, the bad road, and the
weight, it was placed in a cart, and I sent with
it my chaplain and vicar to the church of Avon,
with three men to assist, and orders to bury
the body within the church near the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bénitier</span>,’
and this was done at three quarters past
five that same evening.</p>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lebel.</span>”</div>
<p class='c016' >The church, or rather chapel of the Holy
Trinity, was founded by Francis the First, but
ornamented in Henry the Fourth’s reign. The
niches near the altar contain the statues in
white marble of Charlemagne, and Louis the
Ninth, the sainted king. Louis the Fifteenth’s
marriage with the daughter of the unfortunate
Stanislas, king of Poland, was celebrated here,
and latterly that of the Duke of Orleans with
the Princess Helen.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is to be repaired without delay, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
before reparation is needful, as the deep cracks
through the ceilings and faded frescoes
testify. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie de François Premier</span>
was built and decorated in his time and yet
unrestored; the pale salamanders are barely
visible on the walls. The queen’s antechamber
was the imperial dining-room in Napoleon’s
time, and the Salon de Reception the apartment
in which Louis the Thirteenth was born.
King Henry threw open one of those windows
to announce the news to his courtiers, who were
walking in the oval court below. The chamber
of St. Louis formed part of a pavilion
built during his reign, but bears no trace of
ancient architecture; over its chimney is a
fine Henry the Fourth on horseback, in white
marble; it belonged to a chimney piece,
which gave its name to the hall, changed in
Louis the Fifteenth’s time to a shabby theatre,
for it was called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de la belle Cheminée</span>.
The statues of Strength and Peace were the
chivalrous king’s fitting supporters. The whole
was thrown aside in the stores of the Château,
and left there dusty and forgotten, till Louis
Philip’s command replaced the equestrian statue
in St. Louis’s chamber, and the other two in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle des Gardes</span> adjoining.</p>

<p class='c010' >A corridor conducts to the gallery of Henry
the Second. It was built by Francis the First,
and decorated by his son; and now its ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
glory revived with scrupulous fidelity, the
deep ornamented recesses in which the five
tall windows on each side are sunk, the
gorgeous ceiling, the walls covered with gold,
and frescoes by Primatice or Nicolo, are, even
to the silver crescent and the cypher, reappearing
at every step, the same as when
Diana of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poitiers</span> and her royal lover trod
its floor. The only loss it has sustained is
that of the two bronze satyrs eight feet high
which supported the chimney-piece: they were
seized for ammunition in 1793, and Napoleon
replaced them by two pillars now standing.
The chimney-piece was the work of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rondelet,</span>
Francis the First’s famous sculptor; its centre
exhibits the arms of France, encircled by a
wreath and crowned by Diana’s crescent.
There are two pictures at this end of the
hall; one of Francis killing a wild boar in the
forest, the other of the famous combat of a
condemned man with a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loup-cervier</span>, which
desolated the country round Fontainebleau.
He was a nobleman, and besought permission
to meet his death in this manner, but, having
exterminated the monster, he was pardoned.
At one time this hall was called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie des
Réformés</span>; for the Calvinists, with Admiral
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coligny</span> at their head, here presented to
Francis the Second the first petition in which
they styled themselves “Reformers.” The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
Admiral was their organ to the young king,
whose brother was to be his murderer. The
ball on the Duke of Orleans’ marriage was
given in this hall. The windows to the park
look on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Étang</span> and its pavilion, which
bore the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cabinet de Conseil</span>, when
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catherine de Médicis</span>, and after her the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cardinal de Richelieu</span>, retired there with their
secret advisers. Directly beneath the gallery
is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle Louis Philippe</span>, which was, in
Louis the Fourteenth’s reign, the Dauphin’s
apartments, now a magnificent dining-hall,
supported by Doric columns, and ornamented
in the taste of the Renaissance. Opposite its
five windows, on the parterre, are three superb
entrances, opening on a corridor lighted by
glass doors, which look on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cour Ovale</span>;
a fourth entrance communicates with the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte Dorée</span>. It is a splendid porch or
portico, brilliant with gilding and just revived
frescos, its length the width of the dining-hall—at
one end opening on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allée de
Maintenon</span>, named, by the proudest and
vainest king in Europe, after his plebeian
wife; at the other on the Oval Court, which
I mentioned before, but did not tell you that
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donjon</span> which terminates it is the spot
where Louis the Thirteenth was christened
when seven years old. A flight of steps on
either side of the entrance arch conducts to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
the open chamber it supports, and the child
was named there in public; all catholic ceremonial
observed, that no doubts of his creed
might rest on the people’s minds.</p>

<p class='c010' >Perhaps my long description of Fontainebleau
has wearied you, and yet I might continue it
much longer; so large a portion of French
history is connected with its walls. The guide
pointed to the tower in which the Marshal,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Biron</span>, past the night after his arrest,
ere he was transferred to the Bastille. Notwithstanding
that Henry the Fourth had three times
saved his life in battle, and designed to
make him his son-in-law, he conspired against
him with the Duke of Savoy. France was to
be divided into as many petty sovereignties
as provinces, all placed under the protection
of the king of Spain; and the bribe which
seduced <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biron</span>, who was the vainest and
bravest man of his day, consisted of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Franche
Comté</span> and Burgundy, and a marriage with a
daughter of Spain or Savoy. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lafin,</span> confidant
of the traitor-duke, betrayed him in turn, but
had the art to persuade him of the king’s
ignorance, when he summoned his former
friend to his presence, and the marshal
denied everything.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Marshal,” said the king, “I must hear
from your own mouth what I unhappily know
already. Speak to me but frankly, and whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
your crime against me, I promise you
protection and pardon.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Your majesty presses a man of honour too
far,” said the marshal impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Would to God it were so,” rejoined Henry
the Fourth sadly; “reflect ere you reply.”
The general remained silent, and the king
walked slowly to the door; and, as he reached
it, said, still more in sorrow than in anger:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adieu, Baron de Biron</span>.” He was tried and
condemned; and beheaded within the gates
of the Bastille.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cour du Cheval Blanc</span>, silent as it is
now, calls back Napoleon’s adieus to his old
guard, which took place here.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>April 6th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Notwithstanding the most bitter of east
winds, we have ridden over great part of the
forest, the wildest and finest I ever saw. Its
groves of old oak, interspersed with tracts
clothed with black firs, and hills, and valleys
of barren stone; the Hermitage of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Franchard</span>;
the wonderful <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roche qui pleure</span>, through which
filters water, which the good peasants still
collect as a sovereign remedy against disease,
are on the Paris side of the forest. Shortly
before arriving at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Franchard</span>, there is a plain
iron cross raised on a heap of flints, the scene
of some old murder. Our road from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
town lay through oaks in their hundred
years’ majesty: the box forming dark thickets
everywhere, and the ground between already
blue and white with periwinkles and anemones.
In summer it is one carpet of flowers.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Franchard</span> had a hermitage even in the time of
our <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>; it became afterwards
a monastery which was also deserted:
shortly after the battle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Castelnaudary</span>, its
last inhabitant arrived thither, and lived and
died alone in its ruins. It was whispered at
the time, that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Moret</span>, who (some
said) had perished in the battle, had on the
contrary received but some slight wounds
which in no way endangered his life; he had
disappeared: and the recluse who hid himself
in poverty and solitude at the same period
was believed to conceal from the vindictive
cardinal the companion in arms of the unhappy
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmorency</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The valley of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Solle</span> is on the other side
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande route</span>. The steep road dips
suddenly down, winding among fantastic rocks,
piled one on the other, overgrown with brilliant
mosses, trees growing luxuriantly on or among
them. I noticed some whose trunks shot upwards
from so narrow a place of support, that
the branches on either side seemed extended to
poise them, as a bird spreads its wings for the
air to bear it up; and others, whose roots
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
stretched themselves over the bare granite
platform, casing it to its edge, and thence
dropped down to plant themselves in the earth
which nourishes them scantily. In this part
of the forest the holly grows everywhere, and
is gay with red berries even now. We were
doubtful of the way back; and Fanny, whose
sagacity has been so often proved, was called
on to assist. When the reins are laid on her
neck, she is perfectly aware of her own importance,
and stops and snuffles at each road
she sees, often choosing short-cuts and footpaths.
To-day, after leaving the valley, we
came suddenly on one of the abrupt rocky hills
which we have met with often here; there was
a broad alley on each side, but Fanny chose
neither, and taking a little track through the
trees, trotted on and up, climbing like a cat,
and when I dismounted to ease her, pulling
me on by the rein I held. Arrived at the top,
from the little arid plain we found a view
worth our trouble; down the other side she
led again, emerging in a bridle-road, from
which branched eight others. She considered
a moment, and then, hurrying as she does when
her mind is made up, she chose one of these
alleys, and in five minutes we passed a finger-post,
which marked it, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chemin de Fontainebleau</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010' >On the Paris road is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix du Grand
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
Veneur</span>: he is the hero of terrible tales, being
a spectre, who often and on various occasions
has appeared to the kings of France. The last
who saw him was Henry the Fourth. One day
of the year 1599 he had been hunting unsuccessfully,
for his hounds had twice lost the
scent, and he was slowly riding back through
the forest on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moret</span> side, when his ill-humour
was increased by suddenly hearing the
cry of dogs and the flourish of hunting horns,
which seemed to sound a triumphant blast.
The king, who rode at some distance from his
attendants with the Count of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soissons</span>, turned
angrily to him, “Note who the bold intruder
may be,” he exclaimed, and the count, with
several of the courtiers, spurred towards the
sound. As they disappeared, the king started
back, for a tall huntsman,—tall beyond human
height,—attired in black, with a shining eye
and livid cheek, stood before him. He accosted
the monarch in a voice of thunder, and said,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amendez-vous</span>.” Henry’s look for a moment
quailed before him; and when he fixed
it on the spot where the huntsman had stood,
he was gone. The Count of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soissons</span> and his
companions returned, said they had seen,
but at a distance, a dark huntsman, at the
head of a numerous hunt, mounted on horses
which seemed to feel the rocky soil no obstacle.
Whether he came to warn the king of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
a darkening future and bloody close, I cannot
tell; some say he spoke more than the monarch
told; he rode the rest of the way in silence.
After this apparition the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Veneur</span>
continued to be heard at times, though
he was not seen again. Once, (Sully says,)
when he waited impatiently for Henry’s return
to communicate some important affair, he
heard the horns and horses’ hoofs close to the
chateau, and ran out to meet him, but nothing
was visible; and when the king had really
come, he learned he had been at the time four
leagues away.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>7th April.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Walked to-day (the east wind sharper
than ever) to the church at Avon, where
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monaldeschi</span> lies,
under the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bénitier</span>. The
crime for which Christina murdered him
was never precisely known; but it was hinted
that he had been a favoured and then fickle
lover. Taking the right road through the
park, and along the canal made by Henry the
Fourth, it is hardly distant the quarter of a
league it is called; we took the wrong and a
much longer way. The little old edifice was
built in the tenth century, and stands at the
end of the unpaved dirty village. A washerwoman
and a dozen children came to see what
we wanted. We wanted to get into the locked-up
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
church, and were desired to apply at the
seminary, which is nearly opposite. The
porter issued with the key. He was the roundest,
merriest, ugliest, piece of human nature
imaginable; I should think he acted cook as
well as porter, and he is quite out of keeping
with the spot where he stood. With its low
gloomy arches, and damp irregular pavement
of worn tombstones, it seems the fitting place
for the hurried interment of a murdered man,
in the dusk of a winter’s evening. One of the
flags of the choir is marked with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</span>,
and a half-effaced figure; below is the
heart of Philip le Bel’s queen, who died here
about 1304. Two old painted windows light
the church dimly; near the entrance door, just
in front of the antique vessel for holy water,
is the narrow stone inscribed with ancient
letters, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ci gît Monaldexi</span>.” The porter told
a strange story.</p>

<p class='c010' >Three years since, (the village church being
then always left open,) a party of Englishmen
came to visit it. They arrived with a number
of workmen, hired in the cottages, and whom
they had paid beforehand, and liberally, for
the work to be done. By their employers’
order these men opened the grave, to take
possession of the skeleton, for the English gentlemen
asserted that <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monaldeschi</span> was their
relation. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</span> had been absent, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
returned during this extraordinary operation,
and flew to forbid sacrilege! The workmen
ceased, but they had been so diligent that the
bones were already uncovered, and the Englishmen
insisted on carrying them away; and,
despite of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</span>, held the skull fast. Finding
his remonstrances useless, the priest hurried
away, and returned with some <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens-d’armes</span>,
when the skull was replaced in the
coffin.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Englishmen were allowed to depart.
They had cracked, in their labour, the grave-stone,
and crumbled a good many of those beside
it; a large square of brick-work replaces
them. “Since then,” the porter said, winking
at us, as if he fancied we too had some design
on the bones he guards, “when strangers are
curious, I accompany them, and we keep the
church locked.”</p>

<div class='c012'><span class='small'>10th April.</span></div>
<p class='c011' >A pretty road through the forest, on whose
borders is the old town of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moret</span>; its ancient
gateway and the ruins of its fortifications and
strong castle looking picturesque through the
trees. The fine gothic church remains, but
the convent, which was honoured by the presence
of a royal nun, no longer exists. Louis
the Fourteenth had by his wife, Maria Theresa,
a daughter, who came into the world perfectly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
black. The King not choosing to own a
negress, it was asserted that she had died; she
was committed to the custody of these walls,
and well and respectfully treated, for the abbess
received a large annuity on her account.
It is said that her royal father and mother
sometimes came to see her; perhaps the comparison
between what she was and might have
been, but for the caprice of nature, preyed on
her mind, for her life was not a long one. Two
saints, of unquestionable merit, have chapels
in their honour near Moret. St. Nicaise will
cure the most obstinate cough, and St. Memert
the bite of a mad dog.</p>

<p class='c010' >The next post very uninteresting, to Fossard,
which is one of those wretched-looking
villages which straggle along each side of the
broad, bad roads of France. Stopped to sleep
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve la Guyard</span>, a hopeless-looking
place with a good inn, though it does not fulfil
the promise of its printed card, which speaks
of “new and splendid furniture, French and
English attendance, large and commodious
stables, baths, and a garden of rare plants adjoining.”
The chambers hung with painted
canvass, thick with the dust of years, and the
square hole cut in the panel of the door, that
the blast rushing in might prevent the chimneys
smoking, did not quite answer the expectations
raised. The groom of the filthy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
stable, for French stables are cleaned once a
year only, was a feeble, gray peasant. The fat
girl waited alternately on us and the diligence
dinner; the baths were invisible, as was the
garden, unless represented by the strip where
primroses and cabbages grew among broken
crockery, protected by the paling, on which
hung to dry an avenue of cotton pocket-handkerchiefs.
There was nothing to see when we
had walked round the little church, and been
driven home by the troop of urchins who, just
out of school, clattered after me in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</span>.
Returned to the inn yard, we found there an
amusing specimen of French manners in a
certain class. By the well sat, in an oilskin
cape and cloak, an old gentleman, who with
his wife we had seen arrive in a one-horse
vehicle. He was dripping like a river-god, and
she, in the attitude of Hebe, pouring on his
bare head jugs of well-water. As neither were at
all embarrassed, we were soon acquainted; he
had attacks of blood to the head, and therefore
the watering of it by three buckets at a
time is performed twice a day, and the operation
of cupping three times a week, by his wife,
who has taken lessons on purpose; like some
other good people, she likes complaining, and
before we had been known to each other five
minutes, she told me that since her husband
had retired from business, this malady had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
come upon him; that they had travelled to
see the sea, and it had <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyé</span> him; that they
were now on their way to drink the waters in
Savoy, and he already spoke of turning back;
in short, that he was impatient and fanciful, and
made her life insupportable. A great source
of grief and fidget to him was the old horse,
lean and uncleaned, who daily dragged themselves
and baggage in the heavy vehicle. He
wondered he was not fat and hungry like ours.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>11th April.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left early, intending to sleep at Sens for
the sake of the cathedral. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont-sur-Yonne</span>,
which lies on the road, has an old church and
fine bridge. The entrance to Sens under the
arched gateway is striking; and its boulevards
and public promenades remarkably neat and
pretty. When we rode into the yard of the
Ecu, we found mine host, who came to meet us,
high in his charges and impertinent besides;
so turned the horses’ heads again,—merely fed
them at an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span> close by, and went on. I
saw only the exterior of the fine cathedral.
A quarter of a league from Sens was the
abbey of St. Colombe, where Thomas à Becket
hid himself three years from the fury of Henry
of England. A beautiful shining day, for the
east wind has yielded at last. The approach
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve le Roy</span> is through a pretty tranquil
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
country, the road winding along the bank
of the river, and sheltered on the other side
by an abruptly rising ground, planted with
vineyards. An elbow in this road brings suddenly
in sight the old town’s gateway: like
that of Moret, an entrance-arch, flanked by
turrets, with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouttière</span> above, whence
boiling pitch and lead poured on the intruder.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is of Louis the Sixth’s time, I was going
to say it has frowned there ever since; but
this evening, in the golden sunshine, it smiled
in harmony with all the rest: the troops of gay
boys at play under the care of a good-natured
priest, and the bright little stream which
bathed Fanny’s tired feet.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had good beds and a decent stable at
the inn; but its butcher and cook are
“leagued to destroy.” Our French acquaintance
had arrived before us,—just as the lady-innkeeper
was telling me her country people
were far better travellers than formerly, as
they ate and drank and paid uncomplainingly
now, as the English once had done, my
friend, who had seen us dismount, came to
greet me, and tell (in the landlady’s presence)
that every thing in the house was extravagant
and execrable; and then, having surveyed the
chamber selected for us, insisted on her yielding
one better, in which we are installed,
thanks to her. We walked together in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
evening to the pretty gardens outside the
town: it has a similar entrance at its other extremity,
and the ancient walls and towers of the
fortifications remain; and the moat, converted
to peaceful uses, now forms bright gardens,
covered with blossom.</p>

<p class='c010' >I bought for a franc an enormous basket of
carrots for the horses; and when we returned
to the inn, my companion elevated one before
the eyes of the landlady, reproaching her with
its being the same size for which that morning
she demanded five sous!</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>12th April.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve</span> for Auxerre; a north-east
wind and gloomy sky again, under
which the scene looked disenchanted. A
less uninteresting country as far as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Joigny</span>,
which is built on the height, its houses and
churches rising in terraces with a broad quay
and handsome bridge, but neither trees nor
flower-gardens as in a country town in England;
looking this grey, cold day only dirt
and barrenness. We met, as we passed along,
our feverish acquaintance, he walking to cool
his head without a hat; his lady abusing
the hotel, where their horse was feeding; they
too were bound for Auxerre.</p>

<p class='c010' >Nothing more melancholy than <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Joigny</span>, excepting
the road beyond it; it crosses the
bridge, and lies over a marshy flat, lately
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
overflowed by the river, and seeming to produce
little, saving a few willows and broom-like
poplars. We have pavement again for
some miles here, and the sides of the road
were impassable. Leaving <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bassou</span>, a hopeless
looking place, behind, we were in the vine
country: an ugly one it is, but this is the
place of all Gaul where the grape was first
grown in the third century. From a long
steep hill we looked back on a most gloomy
though extensive view; its descent leads to
Auxerre. At the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte de Paris</span> was our hatless
friend, who had passed us on the way; he
was good-naturedly watching our coming to
point out the road to the Leopard; we should
otherwise have made a long round instead of
riding down the avenue to the quay where it
stands. It is a comfortable and reasonable
inn, and the view up and down the broad
river, with bridge and islands and barges,
very pretty. The avenue before the hotel,
and along the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Yonne</span>, is the walk of the
Auxerre fashionables; a formidable looking
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune France</span>” was promenading there, but
now magnificent in curls and beard and crimson
cloak and cigar. The town, whose
streets are high and narrow, looks to advantage
from the river; it is built in an amphitheatre,
the old abbey of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Germain,</span> the
prefecture, the cathedral towers, and those of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
other fine churches, rising tier above tier over
the quay. I walked in quest of letters to the
post-office, and found that to do so required
strength of mind, for a bonnet forms no part
of my baggage: and I went in my riding
habit, as I dismounted, followed by all the
little boys and girls, and some of their papas
and mammas: the very clerk at the post-office,
civil as he was, could not refrain from several
questions, the “how and whence” respecting
the first habit which had been seen at Auxerre.
Yet we are only forty leagues from Paris, and
the Parisians have lately made riding so
fashionable, that I have heard young ladies,
asked whether they liked the exercise, exclaim
they “adored it,” and seen gentlemen of
fifty on ponies follow in the train of the riding
master. The cathedral is small and beautiful;
we stood near one of the side entrances
admiring the elegance of its Nun’s-walk, and
the view down the aisle, where it circles round
the choir, and arches and columns seem crowded
together.</p>

<p class='c010' >The finely carved capitals of these columns
were lighted brilliantly and variously by the
sunbeams through the rich stained windows.
The prospect from the nave would be open to
the chapel behind the high altar, but that
modern taste has suspended over the latter a
wooden ornament, closely resembling the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
tester of a bed; it intercepts the view of the
lovely little chapel, and the strangely light
pillars which support it; on one of these is
pasted a paper, promising “plenary indulgence”
to all such as on saints’ days, therein
specified, shall recite particular prayers. So
all who are “heavy laden” repair to the
chapel at Auxerre.</p>

<p class='c010' >On the wall close by is a tablet to the
memory of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Georges de Beauvoir</span>, Marshal of
Chastellux, who, in the year 1444, retook the
town of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crevant</span> from the English, and with
his own hand (says the inscription) killed the
Lord High Constable of Scotland. The celebrated
Amyot, preceptor of King Henry the
Third, is also interred here; it is said that the
chapter, formerly rich, ruined itself by lawsuits,
and one is particularly cited which lasted
a long time. The canons asserted their right
of wearing ermine on their robes; it was forbidden
them; some yielded, others were stubborn:
they were called, to distinguish them,
“Trimmed” and “Untrimmed.” Litigation
ensued, and the last named gained the lawsuit,
when it had been pending one hundred years.</p>

<p class='c010' >The cathedral has some customs peculiar
to itself. A strange one was abolished only
in the sixteenth century. The canons were in
the habit of playing at ball in the nave, and
for money, and the sums thus won were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
expended in feasts for the chapter. It is said
that it was erected on the site of the first
Christian chapel, raised here in the third century.</p>

<p class='c010' >The old church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Germain</span> near (now
that of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel Dieu</span>, and barbarously
whitewashed) takes its name from the sixth
Bishop of Auxerre, who first built it on the
spot where stood the house in which he was
born, and who was buried here in 448. The
saint’s story says, that having travelled to
England he there met and converted at Oxford
one Micomer, a learned doctor, whom he then
made his coadjutor in reclaiming Great Britain
from Paganism. Micomer returned to France,
died, and was buried. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Germain</span> visiting
his tomb at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tonnerre</span>, apostrophized his
disciple, now a saint. “Micomer,” he said,
“rise from your tomb: there are fresh disorders
and fallings away in England and
Ireland; rise and go, set all in order.” A
voice replied from the tomb, “Be tranquil,
father, on that subject, for England and Ireland
will not need our interference, and heaven
commands my body to remain in peace here,
and my soul in eternal glory.” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Germain</span>
rejoined, “It is well, may I soon be with you
in paradise.” The subterranean church of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Germain</span> is famous for its antiquity, and
also because it contains, besides the tombs of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
sainted bishops, those of Hugh, Duke of Burgundy,
father of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hugues Capet</span> of France, as
well as of other dukes of Burgundy, and counts
of Auxerre; (for the county of Auxerre belonged
by turns to France and her turbulent
province.) It was united to the crown in Charles
the Fifth’s reign, ceded to the duchy by Charles
the Sixth, and became finally French when
Charles the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Téméraire</span>, last sovereign of Burgundy,
was killed before Nancy. We did not
see the vaults, for the pale, diseased faces
which came round us, as this is now the hospital
church, made it by no means tempting to stay.
Near the church stands its ancient belfry, a
picturesque tower. We went in search of St.
François, which is in the lower part of the
town, and seen outside is a noble gothic building;
within it disappointed me, though indeed
I had barely time to judge of it, for as we entered
we found a whole school on its knees,
which, without any change of position, saluted
my habit and myself with shouts and hootings
notwithstanding the reproving looks of a young
priest, and fairly drove us out and followed us
home, pushing against us to stare closer; so,
having had no room to walk, and barely
enough to breathe to-day, I must buy a bonnet
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span>.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>Rouvray, 14th of April.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Cold weather still, but sunny, and the bridge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
and steep road which looks on Auxerre, once
passed, no view to reward for the long succession
of bare hills. Near the town the vine is much
cultivated, but in France its stunted stumps
give no charm to scenery. Further on the
soil is worse, but prodigiously manured, and
they grow oats and rye in what appears a stiff
red clay, lightened only by layers of flat stones,
which would break English hearts and
ploughs. Nothing to relieve the eye, not a bush,
not a speck of green, not an habitation for
miles on either side of the glaring white road;
we travelled for ever up the steep rise, and
down the sharp descent, which succeed as like
each other and uninteresting as if all had been
cast in the same mould. Fed the horses at a
lone farm-house, and reached at sunset the
prettier country near Lucy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Bois;</span> for the
road for about a mile passes through a young
oak wood, and it was really refreshing to the
sight, as we had not seen a tree for twenty-seven
miles. The village stands in a sheltered
and rather pretty valley, at the foot of a hill,
which is a petty mountain, so thought the post
horses, who toiled up it. We got in at dusk.
The sharp landlady was out, and her delegates
were two good civil old women, her aunt
and mother-in-law, and though it is an humble
inn, we had good beds and a bright fire, and
an excellent dinner from the hands of poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
Annette, whose province is to clean the house,
attend the comers, cook the meals, wash the
linen, milk the cows, make bread, cheese, and
butter, and bear (she told me in confidence)
the blows of the spoilt child.</p>

<p class='c010' >When the hostess returned, we saw no more
of the old people and their civility, but the
fine lady and her imposition instead.</p>

<p class='c010' >Slept at Lucy, and rode on in the morning
to this town, Rouvray, a melancholy road and
wretched place, but the beds, cook, and stabling
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Ancienne Poste</span> very good.
As D—— always stops to feed the horses on the
way, and the wonder my costume excites becomes
very annoying, I to-day took refuge
in the stable, and saw there a great face in a
blue night-cap, staring at me through a hole
in the wall. Before reaching the town we
passed a group of labourers at work, and men
and women ran to the edge of the high bank
above the road to look down at me. I laughed
at their astonishment; a fact the foremost of
the group communicated to the rest, saying,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà que cela nous rit</span>.” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cela</span>” does not
mean a human being, so that I do not exactly
know for what they took me. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons. Digy’s</span>
printed card asserts, in English, that “Post
hotel is situated in the most fine quarter
of town,” which means, the dirtiest end of
the long street. The wind is high, and this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
room smokes, so that we sit with the door ajar,
and the creaking sign, which hangs just at our
windows by iron links, and swings backwards
and forwards, excites agreeable thoughts of
dead men hung in chains. We are to remain
a day or two, notwithstanding, as I am not
well.</p>

<p class='c010' >We hear there is great poverty hereabouts,
yet provisions, except bread, which sells at
the Paris price, are very reasonable. Meat
is only eight or nine sous a pound; but the
labourer receives no more than twenty-four
sous for his day’s hire, and the country people,
like the Irish, live almost entirely on potatoes.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>19th April.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Rouvray for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arnay le Duc</span>, and saw
nothing which at all interested me by the way,
excepting the return post horses trotting
gaily home by themselves. We have fine
weather at last, and so warm, that we stopped
on a little plain, and sat in the shelter of one
of its hillocks, thinking to do so undisturbed;
but a bevy of half black <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourguignonnes,</span> who
were tending thin sheep and unsightly pigs at
a distance, took up a position which commanded
ours, and grinned fearfully till they
drove us out. They form a very unengaging
population. The women, from hard work,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
soon lose all trace of feminine features, and
their costume is unbecoming, as their short
petticoats display their bare, thick, brown
ancles. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arnay le Duc</span> is rather prettily situated
on the river <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arroux,</span> in a valley, which was
formerly commanded by its strong castle, of
which remains but one heavy tower. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel
de la Poste</span> is exceedingly good, and through
this town, for the first time, I was not hooted,
as near it lives a young French lady, who rides.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>20th April, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel du Parc, Chalons.</span></span></div>
<p class='c010' >Sixty miles in two days of burning weather.
I feared Fanny might suffer, and we decided
on remaining a day in this noisy inn, which is
not an agreeable one. I believe the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois
Faisans</span>” to be better. The plain of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Givry,</span>
which we passed over, is surrounded by an interesting
country, as on the right are wooded
defiles, backed by a range of bold hills; and
to the left, beyond the slender white pillar
raised in the meadows, (none could tell me
wherefore,) the view is fertile and extensive,
stretching back towards <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arnay.</span> In front lay
the dirty town, once fortified. We fed our
horses there, and found the inhabitants more
savagely insolent than usual. When we remounted,
Fanny, and even the patient Grizzel,
excited by their shouts, plunged so violently
that they soon cleared a way through
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
the night-capped crowd. From the long hill
above <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Givry,</span> the green plains and distant
heights look to advantage, as does the old
château, with peaked roof and turrets, which
stands by the winding river in the hollow.
We next came on a broad moor, and the
horses enjoyed a long gallop over turf, the
first since Salisbury Plain. It is broken by a
few patches of brushwood, and covered with a
very beautiful purple flower, whose name is
unknown to me. We saw no habitation for
miles; none, indeed, till we reached its extremity,
where there is a lone inn, with ruined
outhouses, in a wild and solitary situation, just
fitting for the last scene of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte St. Martin</span>
melodrama.</p>

<p class='c010' >The road thence descends suddenly, edging
a precipice, and commanding a view which is
a contrast to all we have toiled through till
now. We rode under abrupt banks, and fragments
of reddish rock, and below was a glen,
shut in by hills, or rather small stony mountains,
planted with vines, wherever cultivation
is not impossible. There was no verdure, for
the vine stalks are yet bare of leaves, and the
face of the hills is only varied by the different
tints of rock and soil, and the enclosures of
the small fields, formed by piles of slaty stones
thrown up from them; yet the prospect was
beautiful as well as grand. The broken hill
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
nearest us stood forth in deep shadow; those
before, as well as the narrow valley, lay in
splendid sunshine, and beyond them, through
the haze of heat and distance, shone the windings
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, and stretched the rich plains
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bresse</span>, and above all towered the range of
the Jura, resembling the cloud which hung over
it, but that its rosy white was more delicate
still. At our feet were two villages, so
hidden in their nooks, that we perceived them
only when the road passed directly above.
The furthest is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Rochepot</span>; its square castle,
flanked by four massive towers, covers the
surface of the solitary rock which forms its
foundation, and rises among the cabins, yet at
a commanding distance, as (ere power had departed
and respect had followed) the old
noble once did among his vassals.</p>

<p class='c010' >Two watch-towers are still standing, and the
windows opened at different epochs, some
arched, some Elizabethan, make frames for
the blue sky seen through them, or are lightly
curtained by ivy, which seldom grows luxuriantly
in France; its situation and itself are
such, as, had Scott seen, would not have been
left without a story.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande route</span> winding, passes directly
in its front, and the precipice is scarcely pleasant
with a starting horse, particularly as the
carters we meet crack their whips at me, kindly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
curious to know whether the lady’s seat is as
unsafe as strange. Arrived at the stone cross
on the hill, we lost sight of the castle, but obtained
a lovelier view of the valley, as green
meadows and fruit-trees in flower enlivened
the same bold scenery. I had led Fanny
down, as the descent is rapid, and as I was about
to remount, only Grizzel’s affectionate disposition
spared us an inconvenient adventure.
By the road-side are various marly pools,
whose thin mud seems unlikely to tempt even
a thirsty horse; yet Grizzel left free when
D—— came to assist me, walked towards,
and into it, bending her knees and making
preparations for rolling, in utter disregard of
the saddle and valise she carries. D—— ran
to the edge, but the edge was slippery and
the pool deep, and Grizzel too intent on her
bath to listen to shouts or commands; a stroke
of the long whip was the last resource, and
out of the water she splashed, and, to our dismay,
trotted up a by-path. What was to be
done? to pursue would have quickened her
retreat; by a lucky thought, we led away
little Fanny, and the poor grey had not gone
a hundred yards ere she turned to look for
her, and though she hesitated a little, preferred
the risk of feeling the whip again to
losing her companion; so we rode peaceably
on to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chagny</span>, which is situated in a rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
pretty country, though beyond the valley.
I asked an old woman who was there at work,
the name of its tiny river; she turned round
to gaze at it, as if she then saw it for the
first time, and said “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cela? cela s’appelle la
<em>rivière</em></span>.” Met again to-day several soldiers
going on furlough; one from Africa, bronzed
by its sun. We stopped him to ask whether we
are likely to find our friend Captain ——’s
regiment at Lyons. From <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chagny</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span>,
though but four leagues, seemed a long
distance from the badness of the road: between
them, on a lone flat, we passed the stone
erected to the memory of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Antoine Prévost</span> a
countryman, assassinated here for the sake of
a five-franc piece in his pocket. Met an
exceedingly uncivil waggoner with his team,
who made a face at me! and got in at
sunset, the frogs in the ditches croaking so
loud a “good night,” that they startled the
horses.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> existed as a town of importance,
even previous to Cæsar’s entrance into Gaul,
and was called Orbandale. Cæsar made it
the head-quarters of several legions, and it
increased in importance till the reign of Constantine.
The inhabitants boast that near
their city he beheld in the clouds the luminous
cross which converted him to Christianity.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
It was at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> that the marriage was
negotiated between Clovis and Clotilda, by
whose influence he afterwards became first
Christian King of France. It was to him
that St. Remy made that fine speech before
his baptism; “Bow the head, barbarian! burn
what you have adored; reverence what you
have burned.” The scene of the exploits of
the famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brunehaud</span> was also laid here; she
was second wife to King Gontran; his first
spouse Austragilda, who died at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span>,
made a singular request to her husband:—“I
pray you, sire, put to death all those unskilful
leeches who have failed to cure my malady.”
King Gontran promised to give her this
token of affection, and kept his word, and
yet—he has been canonized!!! The parish
of St. Laurent, which was formerly a little
town with privileges of its own, occupies an
island formed by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>. It had once
a convent of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cordeliers,</span> in the church of
which was the tomb of a monk who was its
superior. The historian of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> says he
was the only brother of Alphonso the Fifth,
King of Portugal; in 1481, he wandered
hither and assumed the cowl: the king dying
childless, ambassadors came to offer him the
crown he had inherited; he refused it, and
dismissed them as well as his mother the
queen dowager, who strove to persuade him
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
by entreaties and vain tears. At last, in
despair, she departed and retired to die
among the poor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cordeliers</span> of St. Claire
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auxonne,</span> where she is interred. Of all
the riches of Portugal, Father John only
accepted what sufficed to decorate the church
of his convent, and died in 1525, having
chosen to be the principal of five and
twenty mendicant monks, rather than to rule
a kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having purchased a bonnet, I walked
after dinner to the cathedral. It is believed
to have existed from the earliest epoch of
Christianity; ruined by the Saracens, it was
magnificently rebuilt by Charlemagne in the
commencement of the ninth century. It fell
into decay five hundred years after, and the
present edifice is of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. It is an extensive and
solemn-looking building. We saw it imperfectly
and for a few minutes only; not arriving
till after sunset. The side aisles are shorter
than the nave, and the arch, which descends
lower where the transept crosses the latter,
gives it weight and gloom; but the nun’s
walk, with an open gallery below and above,
is light and beautiful. The armed and
gilded figures, which seem to guard the choir,
belong to the tombs of some of the old Counts
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> buried here. The chapels are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
rich in ornaments, having belonged to the
chief families of the country, mostly to those
which have given bishops to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span>. In
one of them kneels a painted statue attired
in its robes, which, though it might possess
little illusion in broad daylight, made us
start in the gloom, looking though “lifeless
so very lifelike.” The unfinished portal is
about to be completed; and this part of
the cathedral is screened off for the present
by most curious old tapestry, seemingly of
Francis the First’s time. The small irregular
place in front of the church is surrounded by
houses with projecting upper stories, and
carved cherubims at their corners, resembling
those at Tewkesbury; but nothing at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span>
appears to date back to 590, though it is
pretended that a part of the palace occupied
by King Gontran still remains. We go to-morrow,
for the quay below our windows is
the spot whence the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span> steamers start;
and the noise exceeds that of a Saturday night
at Birmingham: the horses are uncomfortably
situated, not only from the extreme
filthiness of the stable, but because one end
of its enormous space is merely separated by
a curtain from the open coach-house, and the
other by a glass partition from the kitchen;
luckily they are good travellers. We dined
yesterday in our own rooms and well, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
to-day at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span>, the worst I have
seen yet, and having a nasty appendage in a
lavoir opposite, with often-used soap on its
edge, and dirty towels for drapery; the diners
washed their hands as they came in—a most
odious custom.</p>

<div class='c017'><span class='small'>23d April.</span></div>
<p class='c011' >Arrived here last evening, having left the
inn yard at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> under the inspection of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
all the guests assembled there for breakfast.
Remembered, when we had crossed the bridge,
having left no address for my bonnet, which
is to be sent after me to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span>; and were
obliged to ride back.</p>

<p class='c010' >From <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sennecey</span>, two posts; a
long fertile plain bounded by hills; to the
left, in the distance, the Swiss mountains.
The only sights at dirty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sennecey</span>, a horridly
gigantic head grinning with its tongue out,
transplanted from some fountain to the wall
of the first house, and a very old fort at
its extremity, within whose walls the parish
church has been lately erected. The extensive
plain which again succeeds is skirted by
nearer and wooded hills, whose shade, as we
ascended them, made a pleasant contrast to
the burning, treeless flat below. We let poor
Fanny drink from a clear stream gushing
forth at the foot, over which has been built
a neat <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lavoir.</span> As we walked the horses up
the steep, the view bespoke more comfort
and plenty than does any part of France I
have yet travelled. Green meadows and
fruit trees in flower, and villages dotting
valley and rising ground, reminded me of
England; from the summit the prospect was
enchanting. The descent before us was rapid,
and a few crags made a bold foreground, as
did the Swiss mountains a splendid distance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
Tournus rose in the plain, with its old church
towers and grey abbey, and suspended bridge
across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, whose shores, seen for many
a mile of its windings, merit their name of
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bords fleuris.</span>” This is one of the very best
inns we have yet rested in; close to the
bridge and the river; in all respects superior
to its rival, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauvage,</span> which is at the
entrance of the town in a dull and dirty
situation: but, as it pays postilions at a
ruinous rate, attracts the larger proportion of
post carriages. My indifferent health alters
our destination, for, dreading the heat of an
Italian summer, we go hence to Switzerland
instead of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nismes.</span> Here we remain some
days for letters, and to give rest to our horses,
though they appear to require none. Our
most intimate acquaintance is a fat gentleman,
who is anxious we should take a
furnished château in these environs, which has
its own private theatre, (he has discovered
D——’s taste already,) and, with grounds and
large vineyard, is to be let for thirty pounds
a year; and an old soldier of the empire, one
of the few returned from Moscow, who holds
young France in great contempt, and showed
us the scar of a lance thrust in his throat;
and a sabre cut which crippled his hand:
two of the six wounds for which a grateful
country bestows on him a pension of eight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
sous a day. Do not suppose him a beggar, or
one to whom you could presume to offer
money. Before he was drawn for the conscription
he was a carpenter. After his military
life, unable to return to his first trade,
he took up another, and is now a carrier, and
transports goods in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cariole</span> from Tournus
to the villages surrounding it. We made
acquaintance in the stable, where I had gone
to see Fanny luxuriously rolling on her clean
straw; and he particularly prides himself on
being divested of all prejudices belonging to
the untravelled. Greuze, the painter of the
sweet family-pieces we have so often admired
in the Louvre, was born at Tournus; in the
church is a monument erected in his honour.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>27th April, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span>.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We loitered away the fine weather at Tournus,
and took to-day the melancholy road hither,
with a north-east wind which whirled its dust in
our faces, and made us shiver, as we rode up and
down long hills, which succeed each other without
view or interest. We met a wedding trudging
along a little path which wound through the
clods of a ploughed field, and crossing the
high road and ourselves in the direction of a
village. Three fiddles preceded bride and
bridegroom, who walked arm in arm, and half
a dozen couples of friends and relatives
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
followed; we made a bow to the bride, who was
very plain and looked very proud. The fiddlers
were conscientiously playing with all
their might, and we heard the sharp, squeaking
notes, “like the cracked treble of an old
man’s voice,” long after we lost sight of them.
The female peasantry hereabouts wear a
strange kind of tiny hat tied on the top of the
head, and the white cap: it is about large
enough to fit that of a doll, and above a fair
face might be picturesque, but worn over
weather-beaten features, which the “foreign
aid of ornament cannot serve,” adds to their
natural ugliness; and being so small as barely
to shade one eye, affords no protection against
the burning summer. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Europe</span>
where we are lodged is a good inn situated
on the quay: the view is pretty across the
broad river, and to the plains beyond, and
bounded by the Alps. The inn has good beds
and civil masters, but a bad cook. We dined
to-day at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte,</span> which consisted of
only two besides ourselves, young men of no
very brilliant intellect, for one asked the
waiter whether the radishes served at table
were of this or last year’s growth; and nothing
could persuade the other that the insurrection
of the Lyons workmen was not suscitated by
the English, with a view to destroy the silk-trade.
There is an old horse in these stables
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
thirty-two years of age, they tell me once a
favourite charger of Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span> is a very ancient town, and was of
importance even in Cæsar’s time. Under the
first race of French kings it formed part of the
kingdom of Burgundy; under the second race
the Counts of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span> had insensibly become
hereditary, and after the reign of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hugues
Capet,</span> one of these, yielding to the devotional
feelings which took sudden and absorbing
possession of his mind, retired with his sons
and thirty knights to the monastery of Cluny,
where they assumed the cowl, while at the
same time their wives became nuns in the
abbey of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcigny</span>. The county of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span>
then again formed part of Burgundy, and in
1245 it was sold to St. Louis, King of France,
by Alice, who had inherited it from her father
and brother.</p>

<p class='c010' >The parent of the Countess Alice had, it
was said, dark dealings with bad spirits; and
choosing to place no bridle on his love of enjoyment,
laid violent hands on property belonging
to the two chapters of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span>, and to
the abbey of Cluny. The hour of reckoning
came, and a black man of fearful exterior
appeared one day, and summoned the count
at the foot of his palace stair. Forced to obey,
he mounted, at his silent companion’s sign,
a kind of car, and thereupon miraculously
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
disappeared from his wondering subjects. His
cries of despair were heard and lost in the
distance. “Had he sunk into earth, or melted
in air,” they knew not; but his son, witness of
this event, became a monk, and ceded the
county to his sister Alice, who had espoused
a prince of the blood of France, and her
wishes according with her husband’s, sold to
Louis the holy king, a domain whose unholy
lords ended so fatally. The palace was allowed
to go to decay, and in the sixteenth century
its ruined walls were still visible within the
citadel which was in the centre of the town.
The Countess Alice retired to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbaye des
Lis</span> near Melun, and died its abbess. Long
after, in the year 1562, the Huguenots had
obtained possession of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span> with little violence,
and no shedding of blood. The Marshal
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tavannes</span> several times, and each unsuccessfully,
attempted to retake the town,
until at last he entered it by the means of
traitors bought over. Notwithstanding, in
each street a combat awaited him, but the
Huguenot party, weaker than his own, and
unprepared, wasted its bravery. With the
victorious troops there re-entered the town a
number of women, who, on account of their
shameful lives, had been expelled thence, as
well as the priests, in whose habitations many
of them had been found: they served to point
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
out the houses belonging to men of the Huguenot
creed, particularly of those who had
been active in driving them forth.</p>

<p class='c010' >The butchery which took place would be
too horrid for minute detail; and by means
of merciless pillage, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tavannes</span> and other
leaders made or augmented their fortunes.
Madame de <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tavannes</span> was noted for being particularly
clever in discovering in houses, which
already seemed sacked, the hiding-places of
plate, jewels and linen, with all which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span>
at this time was better supplied than any
town in France. The mournfully famous
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauteries de Mâcon</span> took place when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tavannes</span>,
having departed, left in his place as governor,
a certain St. Poinct, son of a woman who
asserted that a priest was his father. This
man was in the habit of terminating pastimes
and festivals, to which he had invited all the
Catholic ladies of the town, by inquiring if
the farce were ready to be acted (it has since
been called the farce of St. Poinct); and on
receiving a reply in the affirmative, he led
the way to the bridge—I believe the very
same which still crosses from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bresse</span>,
built of stone, with thirteen arches. Hither by
his command, one or two, sometimes more, of
the Huguenot prisoners had already been
summoned; and when St. Poinct arrived, surrounded
by ladies richly attired, he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
enter into gay conversation, joke with them,
and give them hope of pardon, till at his well-known
signal they were seized and cast from
the bridge into the river. It does no honour to
the Catholic dames and damsels of the day,
that D’Aubigné wrote that “this man could
instil into the minds of females, even maids
and children, with the fruits and wines of his
desserts, such feelings as taught them to look
on without pity at the execution of a Huguenot.”
Last night there arrived a Russian
noble, with his train of serfs. The north-east
wind blew bitterly, yet by the master’s order
the groom, who had in some wise offended,
passed the hours till morning, shivering on the
box of the travelling-carriage. One of the
hôtel waiters in pity carried him a bottle of
wine, but as he passed</p>
<div class='c018'><span class='small'>“Betwixt the wind and his nobility,”</span></div>
<p class='c019' >the Russian interfered, the servant received
a reprimand, and the serf no wine.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>28th April.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >From <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mâcon</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villefranche</span> the country
improving; the low hills on the right relieve
the eye, barren as they are. At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. George
de Rognain’s,</span> through which we passed, it
was fair-day, and the streets so crowded,
that we were forced to proceed at a slow
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
walk,—stared, laughed, and hooted at, with
what patience we might. At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villefranche</span> it
was market-day, and our progress was impeded
by droves of horned cattle along the
road: found, when we arrived, all the good
rooms occupied at the post-house, therefore
pay high prices for bad accommodation. We
dined at the same table with a gentleman who
has travelled on horseback from Dijon hither,
and complains of the fatigue piteously! Humbert
the Fourth, sire <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Beaujeu</span>, who died in
1202, singularly privileged the husbands of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villefranche</span>, allowing them to beat their
wives till the blood flowed, provided they did
not die!!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019' >says the popular rhyme, and truly as we rode
it, this warm, lovely morning, it was fair and
fertile beyond any country we have travelled
over. The high grounds on the right covered
with vineyards; on the left, the meadows rich
and green, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>—a sheet of silver,
and enough hill to give the scenery the boldness
it would want otherwise.</p>

<p class='c010' >Droves of oxen again on their way to supply
Lyons; their drivers not more civil than yesterday,—for
they merely said they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
dangerous, without an attempt to leave us room
at either side of the broad road; and their
being savage was a likely consequence of the
heat, and their fatigue—joined to the blows of
the men, and the bites of their dogs. We
kept in the rear till they opened their ranks
themselves, and then cantered through this
most unromantic peril. Our next meeting
was with a runaway cow! galloping at full
speed from her master, whom her unceremonious
haste had commenced by overturning at
the top of the hill, and who was making vain
efforts to come up with her. As we left valiantly
as much room with as little delay as
possible for the fugitive, two post-carriages
passed us, their inmates asleep as usual. We
have not yet met two travellers with their eyes
open.</p>

<p class='c010' >We passed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anse</span>, and its bridge over the
narrow river, which is perhaps a branch of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>:—there is an air of comfort about the
habitations of the poor, not visible in the north
of France or nearer Paris. We noticed that
the improvement commenced near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span>.
At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anse</span> the cottages have neatly-enclosed gardens,
gay with flowers and fruit trees; the
sides of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Route</span>, which here turns abruptly
towards the high hill which towers between
it and Lyons, is bordered by poplars and
willows; the green lanes, branching from it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
have hedges, now white with hawthorn; and
the peach-trees, which it is here the custom to
plant between the rows of vine, are covered with
their delicate blossoms. We remarked, that
nowhere had we noticed so many fine châteaux
as we saw dotting the country here; either
placed, in commanding situations, on the hills
to the right, or nestled in the nooks of the
Mount d’Or itself, which we were ascending.
Perhaps this accounts for the happier aspect
of the dwellings of the poor: they are not,
like those in Normandy, long, unmeaning
buildings, with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mansarde</span> roofs; but for the
most part extremely picturesque, built with
high peaked turrets,—probably in the architecture
of Henry the Fourth’s time. The
steep road is uneven and stony, and we suffered
from its dust, as well as the heat of the
day; but the view of the country to the left,
and that we were leaving behind, was at every
step lovelier, and when we reached the summit,
that of Lyons and its environs which lay
below, in no degree inferior to it, though a
thick haze shut out the Swiss mountains. We
asked three men, within the space of five
minutes, what might be the distance to Lyons:
the first said two leagues; the second, one; and
the third, three. The descent is long and rapid,
passing some wild and beautiful gorges of the
mountain, where the summer residences of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
Lyonnese citizens are thickly scattered, and
when we reached the bottom we were on the
bank of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, its windings on the left
hand leading among green shores, and to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Isle Barbe,</span> and on the right into Lyons. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faubourg de Vaise,</span> through which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande
route</span> runs, gives no very favourable first impression.
We believed that we had mistaken our
way; but the crooked, narrow streets opened
at last on the fine quay, and the finest town-view
ever seen. We both made an exclamation
of surprise at its beauty, which increased
as we proceeded; but my enjoyment of which
Fanny very much interfered with, as she
chose to start more violently than ever, and
the busy quays have often no barrier between
them and the river below but rare placed
curbed stones; sometimes not even these.
We passed the ruined Monastery <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Deux
Amans,</span> a Gothic building, of which little
remains but the walls and a few windows with
light and elegant tracery. It was of the order
of St. Francis, and took its name from a tomb
without an inscription, which existed here in
the sixteenth century, and from time immemorial
had been called that of the Two
Lovers. Some, who exercised their erudition
on the monument, affirmed it to be that of
Herod, king of Judea, and his mistress Herodias,
exiled to Lyons by Caligula. The high
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
crag, which we rode beneath immediately
after, starting so strangely up from the quay
and among houses, with vegetation on its
top, and a mere vestige of broken wall, was
the seat of the strong fortress of Pierre Scise,
held by the archbishops of Lyons till Henry
the Fourth thought it wiser to take possession
of it for the crown.</p>

<p class='c010' >During Louis the Thirteenth’s reign, it was
a state prison, and became that of Cinq Mars,
whose memory <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alfred de Vigny</span> has made imperishable;
another victim to the weakness of
Gaston, and the jealousy of Richelieu. The
rock was of considerable extent, for its fortifications
were cut in its stone, and it hung
over the river; but it has been blasted, and
removed, to widen the quay and afford a passage
for the fine road which leads in zigzags
up the hill to the new fort, which commands
the entire city, and whose cannon would above
all find no difficulty in reducing to powder the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faubourg</span> of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix Rousse</span>, (built on a corresponding
elevation on the other side of the
river,) should the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix Rousse</span> think fit to
renew its revolts of 31 and 34. At a guard-house
we rode by, seeing 66th regiment on
the soldiers’ caps, D—— asked news of our
friend Capt. ——. His battalion is not here, but
is expected shortly, and we have decided on
remaining, as “we three” have not met for years.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
After passing the rock of Pierre Scise, there
is another and lower crag, on which are the
rotting remains of a wooden statue. The
people merely know that it is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon homme
de Vaise,</span> or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de la Roche,</span> who, in
days of yore, gave marriage portions to their
daughters, as is exemplified by the large
wooden purse he holds in his hand. I find
that he was an “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échevin</span>” of Lyons, of German
family: his name was John Fleberg, and
he had been so successful in commerce, that
when the domains of the traitor Constable of
Bourbon were confiscated to the crown, he
was enabled to purchase various châteaux
and estates situated in the neighbourhood of
Lyons, and freed the inhabitants of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vaise</span> of
various seignorial exactions, which had before
lain heavily on them.</p>

<p class='c010' >As the statue has stood and mouldered on its
present pedestal since the year 1550, or 1560,
it has been thrown down by storm or accident
several times, and on such occasions re-installed
with great ceremony. It was long the custom
to carry it in procession, once a year, through
the streets, repaired and fresh painted, and
adorned with flowers; but it has been discontinued
of late, and the head and one arm are
now broken away. We continued to ride
along the quay till we had passed the cathedral,
and crossing the second of the splendid
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
suspension bridges which traverse the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>,
arrived at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Europe</span>, whose entrance
is from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span>, and whose
superb rooms look on the river, and the
bridges of Foy and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span>; a glorious
view, with the lights and shadows of sunset on
it. This 30th of April has been more like
August. We have arrived heated and tired,
but the horses neither: both very hungry,
and little Fanny rolling: which from the character
we purposely give her, she has room to
do in comfort, French ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochers</span>’ standing in
awe of quadrupeds.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>1st of May.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >I think a Frenchman, wishing to impress
a foreigner favourably, might succeed better
in affording him a glimpse of Lyons,
than the same of Paris. Fancy yourself
for a moment standing at one of these
windows, the atmosphere more clear than further
northward in France. The old church on
the opposite bank of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, with two low
massive towers, each surmounted by a cross,
is St. Jean, the cathedral, in part erected during
the reign of Philip Augustus, contemporary
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>. The ugly
ruinous looking building adjoining is the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archevêché.</span> Pius the Seventh, on his way
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
to crown Napoleon, in Paris, Napoleon, on
his road to be crowned in Italy, slept here!
Behind St. Jean rise vineyards and fruit gardens
in steep terraces, gay with white blossom
and delicate verdure,—a background
from which the grey cathedral stands darkly
out. Directly above, on the extreme summit
of the hill, is the small church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre Dame
des Fourvières,</span> remarkable for having escaped
the ravages of the old revolution, during the
whole of which it remained closed, and was
re-opened by Pius the Seventh. A square
tower built near it, on the same platform, in
some degree hurting the effect of the tiny
steeple, is a new and useless observatory. A
little to the left, and lower on the hill, a long
building with three pavilions, half concealed
among old trees, is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Antiquaille</span>, now an
hospital and house of refuge: built on the
site—it is said on the foundations—of the palace
of the emperors, where Germanicus was
born. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span> took its name from a splendid
market erected there in Trajan’s reign, and
called Forum Vetus. On the hill have been
found at various times, pieces of fused metal
and calcined stones, traces of the great fire
which ruined the city in the time of Nero. The
heights of Foy join those of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span>, and
are equally bold, but more barren. When the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
poor young Princess Mary of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Württemberg</span> came
to Lyons on her way to Pisa, where she died,
she insisted on painting this view, though she
did so supported by cushions. The landlord’s
sister showed me her apartments, which join
ours: she says the Princess was so gentle and
uncomplaining, her husband so attached to
her, and both she and the Prince so fond of
their infant, whose sleeping place was in a
cabinet adjoining their bed-chamber, and whom
they were hanging over and admiring twenty
times a-day, that it was heart-breaking to see
her increasing feebleness. When they continued
their journey, he would suffer no other
person to give the assistance necessary, but
himself carried her down the hôtel stairs, and
lifted her into the carriage. She was an artist to
the last; but a day or two before her decease
at Pisa, cheered by warmth and sunshine, she
asked for a pencil, and commenced a sketch of
the fine view from the windows. “The ruling
passion was strong in death.” When the
Prince again passed through Lyons, on his
return to Paris, without her, his appearance
was so changed, that (the people of the inn
say) they barely recognized him.</p>

<p class='c010' >I have just been summoned to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel
Terrace,</span> which looks on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span>,
to see the passage of Nourrit’s funeral procession.
His body had arrived at Lyons in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
travelling carriage, and (transferred to a
hearse only to cross the city) will again be
deposited in a coach at its gates, and hurried
up to Paris. The hearse was preceded by
military, with music and drums muffled, and
the pall covered with crowns of flowers,
offerings made by the towns he has thus been
borne through since Naples; but the two
postilions, who in their common dress rode
the hearse horses, were out of character with
its plumes and draperies. A crowd of Lyons
artists and of Nourrit’s admirers followed,
but the archbishop has refused religious rites
to the actor.</p>

<p class='c010' >This is a most lovely night, like one in
summer, and Lyons looks proud and imposing
seen through the partial obscurity. The
fine deep toll of the cathedral bell, and the
discharges of cannon echoed back from the
range of hills, and carried along by the dark
river, adds to its effect. To-morrow, the fête
of St. Philip, there will be gay rejoicings.
We intend riding to see the races at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Perrache</span>;
for last year a horse who had excited
great hopes, in the hour of trial, despite
whip and spur, went round the course at a
trot.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>May 2nd.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >As we were about to mount our horses
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
in the inn yard this morning, a considerable
crowd assembled to gaze at us, and
completely filled the archway; so that when
we attempted to ride out at it, the porter
was obliged to employ rough words, as well
as entreaties, and his wife whispered in my
ear, that the people were so curious, because
one of them had told the rest that I had
arrived in Lyons for the sole purpose of riding
one of these races. We could do nothing but
move very slowly and patiently among the
wide-eyed and open-mouthed spectators. I
heard some one say close to me in a tone of
contemptuous pity, “Sure, your honour, the
likes of them knows no better,” and looking
round, wondering to find so perfect a brogue
so far from its birthplace, the speaker again
replied to the expression of my face, “Is it
where I come from, your honour? why then,
from Cuffe-street,” and I saw a very red round
face, with a merry blue eye, belonging to an
Irishman with a wooden leg. Paddy has
been a sailor, first in the English, then in the
French service; but to quiet his conscience,
which might reproach him with this caprice
of which he has been guilty, he yields to the
first the palm of superiority, which he says
“altogether proceeds from the system of
flogging,” as “the French navy will never
flourish without that same.” He is now a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
shoemaker, or rather he might be, for, like
many of his countrymen, he abhors control;
and prefers living on the good will of his
acquaintances, in which he succeeds pretty
well, as he is allowed to walk in and out
of the hôtel yard, where his humour and
appearance seldom fail to attract some traveller’s
notice, though he never begs. When
hunger presses and travellers have become
scarce, he takes his line and his basket to the
river and lives uncomplainingly on scanty
fare till the good times come round again.
As he is improvident, so he is popular:
to-day with the silver D—— gave him, he
went away in company of the inhabitants of
the stable invited by him to share the treat.
You see he keeps up his country’s character
for hospitality.</p>

<p class='c010' >We crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span> on our way
to the races, a noble square from its extent;
its fine equestrian statue of Louis the Fourteenth,
the view of the heights of Foy and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span> seen above the tall houses and
the rows of “time honoured” lime trees,
which make a shady promenade on its
southern side. The review took place here.
The race-ground is a plain forming the
centre of a beauteous panorama. We took, to
arrive there, the narrow street which leads
to a place looking sufficiently desert and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
uncared for to be a fitting spot for the purpose
it is put to, when the execution of a
criminal takes place in Lyons; beyond is a
noble boulevard, stretching from river to
river, the Rhone to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>. Crossing this
we almost directly came on the plain of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Perrache</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >Here at the starting place was erected a
booth; and the ladies and authorities of
Lyons, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préfet,</span> &amp;c., occupied seats prepared
for them, the former elegantly attired,
and the latter wearing a look of great
interest, and (what was more wonderful still)
of gravity. Persons on horseback and on foot
were admitted within the well-sanded circle,
and without it were ranged a line of gay
equipages; next, under the tricoloured flag,
came forth the competitors, two by two, a
poster with a tied up tail, a cart-horse with a
long flowing one, a thin light pony, a broken
down English hunter, who, notwithstanding
age and infirmities, I thought would have
won, as the “spirit was willing,” but he was
matched against the poster, and the last
named kept up his awkward canter longest:
and others, whose appearance, from being less
decided, was not more favourable. There
were six in all; the rider of the English horse
had the least ludicrous dress, for he had imitated,
though not faithfully, that of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
English jockey, the rest had followed their own
various tastes. He of the pony wore loose
trousers of dingy white and a short open red
jacket, both seamed and embroidered with
tarnished gold, and his shoulders adorned
with epaulettes, which seemed to have been
ill-used in battle. At his saddle-bow he
carried holsters; his legs had long leather
leggins, and his feet shoes with spurs, but
they rested in no stirrups. The rider of the
poster wore a very long blue jacket covering
his hips, long cloth pantaloons and no spurs,
and a broad orange-coloured sash swathed
him round even from under his arms.</p>

<p class='c010' >The peasant was a very fat man, and he
too had chosen a red jacket and loose white
trousers, but the latter were confined in a
pair of Wellington boots drawn up over them,
and to these the wearer had added tops of
mock-yellow morocco.</p>

<p class='c010' >The first race was between the last mentioned
and the pony, for the highest prize;
and these two first made their appearance,
all the horses were ticketed; a colossal number
inscribed on a white card which hung
below the left ear—these were (1) and
(2); the jockeys came forward, and with
great dignity and much trouble, placed themselves
on a line, after the cart-horse, who was
vicious, had backed to kick the pony. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
the word was given, and they leaned back to
the tails, pulled with one hand and flogged
with the other and started. We had no
trouble in following within the circle sufficiently
close to see all the interesting events
of the race. The pony started a little, and
his rider slipped from the saddle to the sand,
which was thick enough to prevent injury;
during this time the cart-horse gained on him
and the peasant won. The prize was 600
francs. I heard a spectator bet 10 francs on
the pony previous to his misadventure.</p>

<p class='c010' >The other races very much resembled this
one, the horses at starting crossed each other,
and the jockeys rode them against the ropes
at the turn of the course; and each time,
“when the hurly-burly was done,” military
music greeted the victor beneath the tricoloured
flag. When it was all over, the three
winners, preceded by the band of the horse-artillery,
rode in triumph round the course.
The self-satisfied air of the peasant as he
bowed the whole way the head at the back
of which hung the jockey-cap, was the most
amusing sight possible. The sun was burning,
and the excessive heat, and the fatigue of
laughing so much, made us glad to ride home
to rest.</p>

<p class='c010' >The fireworks were splendid, and their
effect enhanced by a sky which threatened
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
storm. The troops, ranged along both quays
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, kept up a harmless fire of those
brilliant white stars which momentarily lighted
up the hills and the city with a lustre of the
purity, but more than the brightness, of
moonshine. They were answered by other
soldiers posted on the height, and at intervals
by the cannon from the fort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span> and
the town; the country and the old cathedral
appeared and vanished by turns through the
smoke and in the varying light. On the bridge
opposite was a palace of diamonds; it brought to
my memory one I saw at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rosny</span>, at a fête given
in honour of the young Duke of Bordeaux, it
was so like; there was only the change of
cypher: and last night the “L.” burned
brightly, but the <i>P.</i> went totally out. The bouquet
went up almost beneath our windows, and
sprang, as it seemed to the clouds, a sheet of
fire, each branch as it burst scattering a
shower, variously and gorgeously coloured, and
illuminating the town, during the few moments
it lasted, more perfectly than did the
day’s sunshine. The crowd uttered an exclamation
of applause. I had no idea, at the time,
that the cries of the dying were mingled with
it. Twelve persons of the working-class, to
see the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-d’artifice</span> better, went out on the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span> in one of their narrow and dangerous
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batelets.</span> They made a sudden movement as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
the bouquet rose, and the boat overturned!
Their cries were heard, and attempts to rescue
them made, which proved vain in the confusion
and partial darkness. Eight contrived
to reach the shore—the remaining four went
down; they formed an entire family—mother,
son, daughter, and the husband, to whom she
had been lately married.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>3rd May.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >As we were standing at the window yesterday
morning, the two expected battalions
of the 66th regiment passed under it, and
D—— ran down stairs to ask news of his
friend. As it happened, he accosted a soldier
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——’s</span> own company. He is still
on leave in Paris, and the man did not know
the precise time of his return. This morning
we started on an expedition we failed to
accomplish; for I wished to see the Isle
Barbe, and the quays on this side the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>
which lead thither become very narrow, and
are high above the water without curb stone
or parapet, and therefore too perilous for
Fanny, who full of spirit started round
from each individual we met, we took the
first narrow road which led up the hill; but,
ere we did so, passed the site of a romantic
story, whose exact date is unknown to me.</p>

<p class='c010' >Nearly opposite the diminished rock on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
which the fortress of Pierre Scise or Encise
once stood advanced into the water, there is
still a tower, which with the remains of a moat
and drawbridge belongs to a house called,
from its present owner, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Vouti.</span>” A
French nobleman, a native of Lyons, had
quitted it to seek his fortunes in Germany,
where he became not only rich, but placed
and favoured at court.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the midst of his prosperity he contracted
an unfortunate attachment to a low-born
maiden, whose grace and beauty did not, in
German eyes, excuse her origin. He married
her; but, unable to bear the disgrace and contempt
which fell upon him, he broke all the
ties which attached him to her country, and
conveyed her to Lyons, where it was his will
to live in almost perfect solitude. The bride
pined in her lonely habitation, rendered sadder
by the now morose temper of the disappointed
noble. She seemed to recover a portion
of her former gaiety only during the
visits of a young man, her husband’s sole
friend and intimate. These visits became
by degrees more frequent, and at last excited
unpleasant feelings in the husband’s mind.
His jealousy once roused, intrigues and false
political accusations enclosed his former associate
within the fortress walls, while his
young wife was conducted to the tower, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
still bears the name of “Tour de la Belle Allemande.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Whether she too felt the love with which she
had inspired the prisoner, or whether indignation
at her own fate and pity for his only
prompted her, the chronicler does not tell;
but from the summit of her gaol-tower she
constantly looked towards Pierre Encise. At
last the day came on which the young man,
profiting by a moment in which the usual
watchfulness had failed, threw himself from
a window, of which he had sawed the bar, into
the river. The current of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span> is
not strong, and he was a skilful swimmer,
and arrived at the opposite shore in safety.
She had watched his progress in hope and
agony; uttering cries he could not hear, and
making signs of encouragement he failed to
see during his strife with the water. At length
he was near, approaching to free her, and
she repeated her signs; and her husband’s
guards, who had watched her strange motions
in wonder, now at last discovered their object.
As he arrived at the foot of the tower, and
stretched forth his arms to her,—as she
stooped over the battlement to greet him—he
fell—the shot had been faithfully and
fatally aimed.</p>

<p class='c010' >The steep stony road (up which D—— led
Grizzle, and little Fanny gaily carried me)
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
led among winding lanes and stone walls to
the summit of the hill, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix Rousse</span>,
which is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faubourg</span> of Lyons, exclusively
occupied by silk weavers, and the head-quarters
of the insurrection. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauche</span> the landlord
said, when we returned, that those who
knew the town and its inhabitants better than
ourselves would scarcely venture there. We
met with no incivility: a few squalid faces
looked out in wonder, for the descent to the
quay for foot passengers is by flights of twenty
or thirty steps each; and between these the
horse-road winds, still so steep, that we had
some difficulty in leading the horses. As we
passed the operatives’ dwellings we agreed
that the temptation of seeing their work in
progress was not sufficiently strong to lead us
within; most were employed with their doors
open, to admit as much air as the narrow
street and hot day suffered to circulate: that
which issued forth was infected; and within,
besides the heavy loom and its pale master,
there seemed barely room for the few articles
of wretched furniture. On the relative position
of manufacturer and workman, my informant
is Mons. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauche</span> the landlord, who, besides
the revenues of this hôtel, now possesses a
landed property worth about 60,000 francs
a-year, and whose vineyards yield 300 hogsheads
of wine annually. He began life as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
workman in the silk trade, so that his two
conditions of operative and proprietor are
likely to make him impartial. At this moment
the purchaser finds silk dear, both in
Paris and Lyons; but precisely in the proportion
that the head manufacturer’s profits increase,
those of the workman decline. The
former takes advantage of the latter’s necessities;
offers reduced prices, and can afford
the delay, if the workman demurs, which the
wants of his family prevent his doing long,
and, having food to buy and rent to pay, he will
accept fifteen or even twelve sous for his long
day’s labour. At present, the usual remuneration
is twenty-two sous, the wife earns
twelve, the children so little that they do not
lighten the burthen; but supposing no incumbrances,
thirty-four sous, the price of the
man and woman’s work, can hardly enable
them to exist and pay house-rent, which is
dear in Lyons.</p>

<p class='c010' >The disturbances of November 1831 had
in their commencement no reference to politics.
The workmen, whose wages were miserably
low, demanded an augmentation.
Their masters summoned them before the
Préfet, and the increase was agreed on in his
presence. The day of payment arrived; the
manufacturers, in greater part, refused to adhere
to their engagements, and the workmen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
meeting in groups of four, had in a short time
in various parts of the city gathered to the
number of many thousands; bearing on their
banners the motto, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vivre en travaillant ou
mourir en combattant.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >In the conflict which followed, the 66th,
then the only regiment in Lyons, lost two
hundred men and thirteen officers. It was
almost totally unsupported; as the greater
part of the National Guard, taken from the
class of which were the insurgents, refused
to act against them.</p>

<p class='c010' >You know that Lyons is famous for its
black and crimson dyes; it is strange that this
superiority should depend on the waters of
the Rhone, all parts of which, as it flows
through Lyons, have not a similar effect. In
one place, for instance, the black dye attains
its perfection; a hundred yards further it
fails. The workmen attribute this to peculiar
properties of springs in the bed of the
river.</p>

<p class='c010' >The most ancient monastery in this, probably
in any part of Gaul, was that of the
Isle Barbe, built in the time of the Emperor
Constantine, about the year 300; its first inhabitants
were a few fugitive Christians, who
had fled thence from Lyons, and from the
troops of the Emperor Severus.</p>

<p class='c010' >The church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aisnay</span>, which we passed on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
our ride from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Perrache</span>,
is built on the foundations of the temple
raised by the sixty tribes of Gaul. That
which exists, of partly Gothic partly Roman
architecture, is such as it was repaired in the
eleventh century, after the ravages of the Saracens.
Long before, Queen <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brunehaud</span> had
ceded to the monks, who possessed a small
hermitage near, the ruins of the edifice dedicated
“to Rome and to Augustus,” on which
they built a magnificent church; but this, as
I said, was pillaged and destroyed in part
by the barbarians. The four massive granite
columns which sustain the roof are, however,
believed to have belonged to the Roman
temple.</p>

<div class='c012'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
<span class='small'>15th May.</span></div>
<p class='c011' >The news of the disturbances in Paris has
set all Lyons in a ferment.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>18th May.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >The weather has been burning. We attempted
riding by the steep streets to the
summit of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span>; but having accomplished
half the ascent, it became so rapid,
and the sharp pavement so slippery, that we
were obliged to dismount and lead the horses
under the walls of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Antiquaille</span>, and up a
road which is rather like a stair to the church.
Not willing to confide our companions to the
tender mercies of the mischievous boys, who
as usual flocked round us, we led them within
the court which surrounds Notre Dame, and
up to the low terrace wall. Grizzle, with her
ready appetite, devoured the few weeds and
moss which grew among the stones; and
Fanny looked as attentively at the view, as if
she were considering her distance from the inn
which was in sight, and the difficulty of getting
back again. The hill is here almost perpendicular.
The streets we had taken to attain
the height, abrupt as they seem, are
zigzags cut in the side of the mountain; and
the city, with its two rivers, spread like a map
below our giddy elevation. The air was particularly
clear, except over the Alps, where a
haze has provokingly hung ever since our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
arrival. We could read “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Europe</span>”
distinctly on the front of the inn on the opposite
side of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span>
was just behind it, its equestrian statue looking
at this distance like a toy; then the broad
Rhone, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg,</span> with its gardens and
promenades, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Route</span> we are
to travel towards the mountains, a white line
crossing bare hills, which seem uninteresting
and interminable. A little to our right was
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont d’Aisnay</span>, traversing the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span> to
the arsenal, a low insignificant looking building.
Farther, in the same direction, the race-ground
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Perrache</span> was visible. About the
year 1808 the people of Lyons presented this
land to Napoleon, and he accepted it as the
site of an Imperial palace! Still beyond we
could distinguish the junction of the Rhone
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, no longer in precisely the same
spot as when Hannibal crossed the Rhone at
the head of his army, where the currents met
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aisnay</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The view to the left is less extensive; the
jutting ground of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span> in some degree
narrows it; but it is fine notwithstanding, and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin des Plantes</span>, green and blossoming as
it is now, appears to advantage on the steep
side of the opposite hill among the confusion
of houses and church towers. It was impossible
to return by the same road, and none
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
of the stupid inhabitants of the hovels about
us could point out another. Merely knowing
the direction, we found our way among hot
lanes, between stone walls, till, after an hour’s
windings, we issued from them opposite the
pretty churchyard of St. Just. A labouring
man, answering our question, said, “There
was a road that way, certainly, but a very bad
one for horses, as it was yet only partly
paved.” I should have thought no one
knowing the pavement of Lyons would have
considered it an advantage. Taking that way,
though he strongly advised returning as we
came, we passed below the extensive fort, in
the completion of which numbers are still employed,
and a few minutes brought us on the
magnificent road, cut for the sole purpose of
making an easy communication between it
and the town, (it winds in broad zigzags, the
whole way commanding a splendid view,) and
arrived at the quay, beneath Pierre Encise.
This new work has also contributed to diminish
the rock; from the river it must have
been a striking object, when the hundred and
twenty steps cut in its stone led up to the
fortress crowned with a large round tower,
whose proportions were of such perfect symmetry.</p>

<p class='c010' >We returned on foot to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span> this
morning; on either side of the narrow lane
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
which leads directly to the church are standings
without number, covered with what seems
on this hill the chief staple of trade,—I mean
chaplets, crowns, and bouquets of dyed artificial
flowers; coloured prints, framed and
glazed, of saints in various attitudes; little
waxen heads, legs, and arms, or whole
figures; votive offerings, which the faithful
present at the shrine of their patron saint,
and find here ready at the church door.</p>

<p class='c010' >The church is kept locked, and we merely
read again the inscription above its entrance,
which gratefully thanks our Lady of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span>,
who saved Lyons from cholera. We
went up the square tower, D—— to the top, I
to the first floor half way, from whose windows
the prospect is perhaps as agreeable. The
guide pointed to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Antiquaille</span>, directly beneath
one of them; it contains, as I told you,
an hospital and penitentiary, and also an
asylum for lunatics; we could distinguish two
of these in the court-yard belonging to the
end of the building facing us; one was leaping
with all his force against the rails, uttering
howls rather like an animal than a human
being; we heard him distinctly; the other close
by, and quite undisturbed, was on his knees
praying, and had been there immoveable (the
man said) for the last two hours. The more
tractable are allowed to walk with their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
keepers in the fine gardens adjoining. It is
said that the dungeon beneath the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Antiquaille</span>
remains unchanged, as in the time when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St.
Pothin,</span> first Bishop of Lyons, was tortured
and murdered there; they pretend to show the
very fetters he wore.</p>

<p class='c010' >From this same window, which looks south,
you can also distinguish the remains of a
Roman amphitheatre, and the commencement
of a Roman aqueduct, whose vestiges
can be traced three leagues further. Still on
the brow of the hill is the square tower of the
church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Irénée</span>, built over the subterranean
chapels where the Christians assembled
in the early days of persecution. We left the
observatory to go thither, passing on our way
four or five broken arches of the aqueduct
constructed by the army of Julius Cæsar,
whose massiveness in ruin puts the perfection
of modern buildings to shame. What I
thought a long walk, with innumerable windings,
and here and there a beautiful glimpse
back to the hills of Burgundy, brought us to
the dirty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg</span>, where, with some trouble,
we found the church. A long flight of steps
leads to a rather uninteresting modern building;
on either side of the choir are two highly
ornamented chapels, one having a finely
painted window; and between the choir and
the chapels are appended to the wall, framed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
and glazed, on one side a list of “Indulgences,”
annexed to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Irénée</span>; on the other
a bull of his Holiness Pius the Seventh. I
thought the latter worth copying; but in the
nave there was a coffin, covered with its pall
and surrounded by high candlesticks, the
black banner with its silver scull and cross
bones attached to each. It certainly was a
melancholy companion, and D—’s imagination
representing to him that the inmate had perhaps
died of some contagious malady, he hurried
me out. A side door and a narrow flight
of steps led to a court at the back of the
church, at the extremity of which, and the
very edge of the hill, commanding here the
most glorious view of Lyons I have yet seen,
is the Calvary, on a raised platform, inclosed
by a railing. Steps led up to it, (as do others to
the vaults below, in which is a representation
of the Holy Sepulchre;) the Saviour on the
cross, the thieves on either side, the Virgin
standing in an attitude of despair, and the
Magdalen kneeling at its foot, are large as
life, and finely sculptured; and of all the similar
groups I have seen, this certainly is
most impressive, perhaps from its position,
looking down on a world, with the blue sky for
a background. Round the court are the stations,
each a small covered altar, a basso
relievo in white marble affixed to each,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
representing a scene of the Passion. The little
dwelling of the Concierge is close by, and he
came to unlock the gate at the top of the stair
which leads to the subterranean chapels. They
are beneath the church, opposite the Calvary.
The light of day penetrates so faintly, that descending
these steps it was difficult to distinguish
what objects we saw piled behind a grated
window on the right hand; it is a mass of
human bones, filling a room of considerable
size, those of the nine thousand massacred in
the year 203, with their bishop, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Irénée</span>, the
greater part in these chapels.</p>

<p class='c010' >Turning to the left, we entered the first and
most ancient; a small vaulted chamber, on
whose bare walls are inscriptions copied from
the writings of the saints, and the Pagan accusations
brought against them. One of these
sentences asserts, that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Polycarpe</span> preached
here at the age of eighty-six years. The
chapel beyond was constructed a century later;
it has an arched roof, supported by ten heavy
columns. A few steps lead up to the altar
built over <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Irénée’s</span> tomb, who, it is said,
was recognised after the massacre. There is
a massive stone bench fixed against the wall
on either side, and in the centre of the floor a
well of extraordinary depth. Tradition tells
that these stones served for headsman’s blocks
to the assassins, and that down the well so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
many bodies were thrown as to gorge it to its
mouth. Some good Catholics believe that,
stooping the ear to the floor, a gushing sound
is sometimes heard, like that of bubbling
blood. I confess I could hear nothing; but the
gloom of the spot is well fitted to such terrible
tales, though it is now in some degree dispelled
by the construction of a new chapel
below the new church, extending behind <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St.
Irénée’s</span> tomb, with bright ornaments and
painted windows, having no associations of its
own, and robbing of their solemnity places
indeed consecrated by the blood of men who
died for their faith there.</p>

<p class='c010' >Beyond this chapel is another small chamber,
of the same date as itself; a recess contains
a hollow stone. The caprice of the assassins
bled to death many of the martyrs, and
their blood cast out here found an issue in the
streets of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg</span>. A broad stone in the
centre of the floor marks the tomb of one <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marguerite
Labarge</span>, who died about 1692. There
is a door in this room, opposite to that opening
on the chapel; and mounting a few steps,
and climbing over rubbish in the obscurity,
we distinguished with some difficulty an
aperture to which our guide pointed, large
enough for a human being to creep through,
and concealed at will by a door of stone, which
when he closed I could not distinguish from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
those which surrounded it. Within there is
sufficient height for a person to stand, and
space to lie down. Her bed was a stone likewise;
I did not see it, (though it remains as in
her time,) for not a ray of light penetrates; she
lived here nine years, having determined on
self-sacrifice at the age of thirty-six. It is
presumed that at night she left her den to
walk in the adjoining chapels, and sought there
what food had been left in charity by such as
revered her for her unfortunate fanaticism;
but her means of subsistence were never
exactly known. When nine years had passed,
a popular commotion taking place forced her
to leave her cell. She appeared again among
the living, and, strange to say, among the
sane; but, her constitution having long resisted
the want of air and necessaries, the returning
to their enjoyment seemed a worse shock, and
shortly after she died. Her family was then in
straitened circumstances; some of its descendants
(become rich) are still residents in Lyons.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Concierge laid great stress on the “Indulgences”
annexed to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Irénée</span>; and twice
told me that any Catholic having died in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">état
de grâce</span>” for whom a mass should be said
before its high altar, would be immediately
transferred from purgatory to Paradise. His
information reminding me of the coffin in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
church. I asked him “who it contained?” he
answered “nobody.” A mass for the soul of a
deceased priest was performed the night
before, and, knowing it was therefore among
those of the blest, he had shown some laziness
in matters of less moment, and failed to remove
the pomp and circumstance. I returned
to copy the pope’s bull:—</p>

<p class='c010' >We were sitting at home owing to the heat
of the day, when the door opened suddenly and
our friend entered. He was just arrived from
Paris, and had found D——’s letter at the
barracks, and came to seek us instantly; we
were all glad to meet again, for it had been
likely that we should never do so, as before
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
Captain de —— went with his regiment to
occupy Ancona, from whence they are just
returned, he passed four years and a half of
constant fighting in Africa. For the sake of
talking over old times, D—— has determined
on remaining till the 30th: Captain de ——
gave us last night some interesting details respecting
the riots which took place in Lyons in
the year 1831; we walked to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin des
Plantes</span>, which from its situation, rather than
its size, is extremely beautiful. It occupies
the side of the hill, and two long flights of
broad steps lead to the entrance gates; from
the nature of the ground, the garden is made
in terraces, and shaded but very steep walks
lead from one to the other. In the artificial
flat made in its centre there is a basin, and
in the basin a fine swan. D—— and myself
commented sometime on the apparent want
of harmony subsisting between him and his
companion, before the latter issuing from the
water we discovered by the colour of his legs
that he was—a goose! The broad terrace
at the summit commands the town below.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières,</span> now on the right, and the other
shore, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Pilatre</span> in the distance, and the
Alps on the left, seen distinctly though delicately
through the green branches of exotics
and trees just in leaf and blossom.</p>

<p class='c010' >Entering the gardens, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la Grande
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
Côte</span> is on the left, bounding that side, for the
workmen’s wretched rooms look down on it.
The street is continued far above and beyond,
and issues on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Bernardines:</span> it
is so steep that a charge of cavalry having
been commanded, was found impossible, at
least farther than a side-gate of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jardin,</span>
where many of the horses fell from exhaustion
and some died. How artillery could be
dragged, as it afterwards was, to the top, it
is difficult to imagine. On the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des
Bernardines,</span> since 1831, has been built a fortified
barrack, thus separating at will Lyons
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix Rousse</span>, which is on the other
side of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Barrière:</span> at the time of the riots
no such separation existed. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des
Bernardines</span> had been occupied by military
from the first moment in which tumult was
expected, but evacuated by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préfet’s</span>
order, who appears to have been strangely
mistaken as to the state of the town. Our
friend Captain de —— was ordered to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span> with his company about three
in the morning; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span> looks on
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux</span>, and is at no great
distance from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin des Plantes</span> on the
town side.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having lost some of his men, he commanded
hardly more than seventy soldiers, when he
joined his colonel there.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
The general and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préfet</span> had their rendezvous
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span>, and, important
as their meeting was, it seemed difficult that
it should take place, for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux</span>
had gradually become thronged; the people
having commenced collecting at daylight,
continued to pour in from every issue, and
more and more menacing every moment, prevented
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bataillon</span> beyond from joining its
comrades. Aware of the danger of approaching
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span>, the colonel’s anxiety
increased.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What will you give me to clear the
place?” asked <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——.</span> “What do you
demand?” exclaimed the colonel. “Five
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >At this time there were present certainly
ten thousand, but unarmed to all appearance,
and as yet undecided as to their future movements.
“Use the butt-ends of your muskets,”
said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——;</span> “knock down as many as
you can and pass over.” The knot of men
obeyed, following himself and his example as
he headed them, distributing blows with the
flat of his sabre. The crowd opened and
retreated, astonished and hardly aware of its
own strength, and bore backwards towards
the steep streets and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix Rousse</span>: and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bataillon</span> which had been unable to pass
moved across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux</span>. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
this juncture it was first recollected that the
arsenal was without protection, and left to the
mercy of the mob; it had been forgotten.
“Capt. ——,” said the general, “conduct your
company there immediately; if it is occupied
by the workmen, retake it; if it is still free,
occupy and defend it.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span> marched his few men to the
arsenal along the quays, and through multitudes
who covered them, not without difficulty,
and arrived in time. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont d’Aisnay</span>
is exactly opposite the arsenal, and the
mob, well armed, occupied the other side of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, and had raised a barricade at that
end of the bridge: it was necessary that the
insurgents should remain ignorant of the
weakness of the force which was to oppose
them. A piece of cannon, by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——’s</span>
order pointed on their barricade, in some
degree served to hold them in awe, though
they kept up a pretty constant fire: they had
no means of knowing that the piece was unloaded,
and the few artillerymen of National
Guard, who had joined the soldiers, were unable
to manœuvre it.</p>

<p class='c010' >During this time it had been necessary to
dislodge the rioters from the position they
occupied in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la Grande Côte</span>, and
others leading to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix Rousse</span>; and here
many fell, fired on from the houses, all which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
the mob occupied. A man deeply regretted
was the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chef de Bataillon Martines</span>, who
received a ball in his chest, in the upper part
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la Grande Côte</span>, where an advancing
house forms an angle. As he fell
from his horse the soldiers stopped vowing
vengeance, but saw none on whom to exercise
it. The light smoke which followed the discharge
issuing from the wall of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</span>
floor betrayed the murderer, and some of the
men of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martines’</span> company rushed into the
house. The assassin had bored a slit in the
wall, and when the soldiers caught sight of
him was quietly and safely reloading. Seeing
them, and expecting no mercy, rather than
wait their approach, he rushed up stairs into a
room on the third floor, and, as the soldiers who
had followed reached the door, flung himself out
on the pavement. The fall did not put an end
to his existence; he was able to rise and
crawl on a few paces. It was not likely he
would meet pity from men whose beloved officer
he had killed: they finished him with their
bayonets. The fire had by this time become
unceasing, and poor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Martines</span>, who had
died instantly, was necessarily left by the
regiment where he fell. After its passage the
corpse was discovered on the pavement by a
party of the insurgents: he must have been a
good and amiable man, for by some of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
he was recognised and deplored deeply as by
his own soldiers. They raised his body and carried
it to a church, where they obliged a priest
to perform the mass for the dead; and thence,
bearing it to the burying ground, interred it
with military honours, themselves firing a volley
over his grave,—these very men, and at
that very time, were towards their opponents
in general guilty of the most atrocious cruelties,
torturing and drowning the wounded.</p>

<p class='c010' >As an instance of the prevailing feeling, I
may mention that a young man had been disabled
by a shot in the leg, which had however
caused no dangerous injury. He was found
stretched on the pavement by a woman, whose
pity he bespoke, hoping she did not belong
to the furies he had seen maltreating his companions:
wanting a weapon, she murdered
him with blows of her sabot! Still, infuriated
and merciless as they were, they in some things
exhibited a feeling of wild justice: before the
doors of such manufacturers as had kept faith
with them, they placed sentinels, and lives
and property were respected. Such as, on the
contrary, had broken through the agreement
made, they pillaged without remorse. Mr.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauche</span> has told me, that he saw in the streets
piles of silks and velvets burning. Several
workmen, who attempted to carry away plunder,
were shot; and the owners, sought after
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
with as much perseverance as rage, barely
escaped with their lives; concealing themselves
in cellars, where they remained in disguise and
half-starved, afraid to show themselves during
the eight days the workmen held possession
of the town.</p>

<p class='c010' >As I said, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span> had entered in time,
and held the arsenal. The third day the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef
de bataillon,</span> his superior officer, arrived: he
brought a proclamation, addressed to the insurgents
by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préfet</span> and the general.</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——,</span>” he said, “you must find
among your men some one who will be bearer
of this, it may put a stop to the riots.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Our friend turned to his company:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is there one among you,” he said, “who,
not in obedience to my order, as I do not command
it, but of his own free-will, will take
charge of this paper?” The soldiers did not
answer; he repeated his question, and they
remained silent.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well then,” he said, “I will go myself.”</p>

<p class='c010' >His men opposed his leaving them with all
their power; they said he had defended them
for three days, and they would not suffer
him to depart. He called them cowards,
took the proclamation, and went.</p>

<p class='c010' >Between the bridge of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aisnay</span> and the
arsenal there is a little Place belonging to the
latter, and closed by its own barrier. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
bridge is no inconsiderable length; and as
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span> advanced along it, and under
the fire of the barricade, he waved the paper
above his head, but it was unlikely it would
neutralize the effect produced by an officer’s
uniform. Arrived at its extremity, and at
the barricade which concealed from him all
that was passing behind, he leaped on and
from it, and on the other side found himself in
the midst of armed men, the greater part intoxicated.
He was received, not as an envoy,
but with shouts of fury; those nearest him
rested their bare knives and bayonets on his
breast, and those more distant took aim at him
with their muskets: he thought it was all over.</p>

<p class='c010' >At this moment a young man, dressed like
the others, as a workman, forced his way to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——,</span> threw himself into his arms
and embraced him.</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! mon pauvre lieutenant,</span>” he exclaimed,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous êtes perdu.</span>” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span>
looked at him, and recognized a private of the
Royal Guard who had served in his own company
before the Revolution of 1830. The
affection, so little looked for, softened him for
a moment, but his firmness did not forsake
him; he took advantage of the pause.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Stand back, and be silent,” he said, in a
tone of authority; “I have something to
read to you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
The men obeyed, half-drunk as they were,
but closed round him again as he ceased.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who is to answer for the execution of
these promises,” they said ferociously, “is it
you?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You are fathers or brothers,” answered
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——;</span> “you have others dependent on
you, and it is important that you should leave
the false position in which you have placed
yourselves. As to me, a life more or less signifies
little to our cause.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The rioters were not disposed to listen to
reason, and their menaces grew more and
more alarming; but the private again interposed,
and by soothing some, and repulsing
others, managed to hold them back while his
old officer again passed the barricade, which
a few moments before seemed likely to be his
monument.</p>

<p class='c010' >During the same day he had a second interview
with some of the insurgents. One of
their leaders sent to request a parley; they
met in the centre of the same bridge of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aisnay, Capt. de ——</span> alone with only his
sabre, the adverse worthy accompanied by
four comrades, and armed to the teeth. Capt.
de —— desired he would order them to
retire. The other repeated his words rather
scornfully: “You will either give the command
this moment,” exclaimed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
who was very much exasperated, “or I will
fling you over the parapet.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The workman looked at him, and judging,
I suppose, that he was sufficiently powerful,
and besides seemed quite willing to do so, he
was intimidated, and obeyed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“And now,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——,</span> “what
do you want with me?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You must yield the arsenal.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That is out of the question.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Then we will take it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Impossible; look there,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——,</span>
pointing to the empty cannon, which
had an imposing aspect behind him; “I might,
had I pleased, have exterminated you long
since, I was only restrained by mercy. Who
are you who make such a demand of me?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I was in the Imperial Guard.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That is untrue,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——,</span>
coolly; “an old soldier of the empire would
not act such a part, or command a drunken
rabble.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The man looked at him for a few moments,
and said after a pause, “You seem a ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon
enfant;</span>’ you should come and dine with us.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I thought the workmen were starving,”
replied the officer.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Their pockets are now full of money; we
dine on the quay opposite, (naming the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span>;)
we will entertain you well.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
“As you were in the Imperial Guard, you
must know that a soldier cannot quit his
post; but I will, if you like, send you some
one,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >“In that case, I give you my oath we will
not attack you again to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010' >They parted; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span> returned to
the arsenal, where he found the ensign of his
company, who had managed to join him in
plain clothes. He sent him to dine with the
workmen, desiring him to eat and drink, and
bring back what information he could, but
make no promises. The rioters did not keep
faith notwithstanding; they renewed their
fire. At midnight came the order for retreat;
and having hid all arms and ammunition,
excepting only a few muskets, they marched
from the arsenal and the town in good order.
Lyons remained in possession of the insurgents
eight days. The Duke of Orleans and Marshal
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soult</span> joined the 66th regiment outside
the town. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span> received the cross
of honour from the former’s hand, and shortly
after promotion. When, in company of other
troops, the 66th returned to occupy Lyons, it
did so with artillery in its front, and matches
lighted, and exasperated to such a degree,
that a single shot fired by a townsman might
have changed the city to a heap of ruins.</p>

<p class='c010' >In France tragedy and comedy are often
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
near neighbours. The royal family, when
they go to Lyons, are always lodged at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Europe</span>. The Duke of Orleans was
there, whether after the disturbances of 1831,
of which we have been speaking, or those of 1834,
I do not at this moment recollect, but the circumstance
M. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauche</span> told me himself. He is a good
hearted but violent man; abuses angrily all
beggars who come to ask relief, and who listen
to him with great humility, quite sure the lecture
will be closed by a shower of sous. Not
being highly educated, when excited, he swears
between each sentence, and, the oath escaped,
takes off his hat and begs pardon, which
lengthens a story and renders it rather obscure.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The Duke came with his staff,” said
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Pauche</span>, “he staid a long time, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">neuf
repas,</span> (French innkeepers count time by
meals;) and as I had so much to do, ——, (the
hat off,) I beg your pardon: I got my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘pièces
montées’</span> from the confectioner, and being in a
hurry, —— (the hat off again,) I ran out for
them myself in my cook’s costume, as you have
seen me, in my white night-cap and apron.
When I arrived back at my own <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte cochère,</span>
—— (I beg your pardon,) there stood National
Guards with crossed bayonets; would
not let me in again, —— (this was a furious
oath); said I, I am <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauche</span>, and that is my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
hôtel, and the Prince is waiting for his second
course, and how do you think he is to get it
if you won’t let me in?” The sentries did not
recognize him; it was all in vain. “And ——
and ——, said I, (the hat off a third time,) I
wish I had my kitchen carving knife.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Finding remonstrance useless, he at last
seized a national guard by the collar, and
made a forcible entry, dragging him after
him to the scene of his culinary labours.</p>

<p class='c010' >“And now,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Pauche</span>, catching
up a long ladle with his free hand, and
pointing to his row of cooks, and then shaking
it at the half-choked national guard, “Now
do you believe I am <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chez moi?</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >On our return to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Europe</span> we
passed again across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux,</span>
and before the church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Nizier</span>. In the
latter, in the year 1834, a terrible scene was
acted; the troops having at last obtained the
mastery, the insurgents were pursued here,
and two or three hundred killed within these
quiet walls. The disturbances of 1834 appear,
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Pauche’s</span> account, to have
been equally terrible, for a time, with those
of 1831. The rioters had taken up their position
on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span>, where they had even
posted cannon. When they were at last dislodged,
a great many escaped by letting themselves
drop from the terrace wall to the vineyard
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
below,—no slight fall, but probably on
soft ground. It was possible from the hôtel
to see them execute this manœuvre, and having
performed it, slip away in safety among
the bushes. At this time there were incendiaries
among the disaffected, for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Pauche,</span> naturally fearing for the lives of all
in his hôtel, which was just opposite <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières</span>,
wisely went to his country house, and at
the moment he passed saw several houses in
flames between the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span> and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de la Guillotière</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >You will wonder that I have yet said nothing
of St. Jean, the cathedral, yet there I
have been many times. We visited it again
yesterday. The architecture of the nave is of
the time of Philip Augustus. The choir is celebrated
as the spot where Gregory the Tenth
held the second council general of Lyons, in
the year 1274. Its members occupied themselves
with the union of the Greek and Latin
churches, and in memory of this reconciliation
two crosses, one Greek the other Roman, were
placed at the extremities of the high altar.
Among the treasures preserved by the church
are the lower jaw of St. John the Baptist,
(you may remember I saw part of his skull at
Amiens,) and the small ivory horn which belonged
to Roland, nephew of Charlemagne,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
and Ariosto’s hero. The house of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont d’Or</span>,
which took its name from the fertile mountain
which rises just outside Lyons, and extends
into Beaujolais, still bearing the same name,
prided itself on tracing its descent from Roland.
Before 1562 this family was one of
great consequence, and the seigneurs of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont
d’Or</span> had the right of repairing to the abbey
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Barbe</span> on Ascension Day, and taking
from the hands of the abbot, who at that period
had it in keeping, the famous ivory horn,
which they might twice sound and exhibit to
the people. During the war of 1562, between
Catholics and Huguenots, this relic was lost, and
continued to be so during two hundred years,
when it was once more recovered, and placed
in the treasury of St. Jean. In one of the side
aisles is a clock, greatly admired by the good
people of Lyons—marking hour, day, year,
temperature, and I do not know what beside,
and having figures, which, when the hour
strikes, perform various evolutions; it is a
frightful machine, between thirty and forty
feet high. Near the principal entrance is the
beautiful chapel of the Bourbons, with its
arched and fretted roof, and fine stained glass,
commenced by Charles of Bourbon, cardinal,
and archbishop of Lyons, who was godfather to
King Charles the Eighth, and who lies
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
interred in this chapel, beneath a white marble
mausoleum; it was finished by his brother,
Peter of Bourbon, called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sire de Beaujeu,</span> who
married Louis the Eleventh’s daughter, Anne.
The motto of his house reappears everywhere:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N’espoir ne peur.</span>” They held ambition, as
well as fear, beneath their dignity. The delicate
carving of the stonework reminded me of Scott’s
description of Melrose; for one might indeed
fancy that some fairy had wreathed the leaves and
flowers and petrified them by a spell. A circumstance
concerning this cathedral I must mention
to you. When the first <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeroy</span>, whose family
has since filled honourable posts in Lyons, was
raised to the dignity of archbishop here, the
members of the chapter (who, from the third
century, when they counted among their body
nine sons of kings and one of an emperor, had
been men of the proudest families of France,
and styled themselves not canons, but Counts
of Lyons) demurred ere they admitted to be
their archbishop, one whose birth did not rank
with theirs, as his great-grandfather was the first
of his name who had held any employ, and his
father the first who had borne a title. Notwithstanding
the refusal of the counts, Louis
the Fourteenth found means to force them to
obedience. When the archbishop harangued
the chapter, he took for text the words of the
Psalmist:</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
“The stone which the builders rejected has
become the headstone of the corner.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The discourse which followed was an insulting
one for the canons, but the dean had sufficient
presence of mind to reply only by reciting
the next verse of the same psalm:</p>

<p class='c010' >“This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous
in our eyes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >We re-crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de l’Archevêché</span> on
our way to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Nizier</span>. Almost behind the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel
de l’Europe</span> is a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place</span>,” and the theatre
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Célestins,</span> where once stood the monastery.
The family of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pazzi</span>, illustrious in
Florence, and the Medici’s mortal enemy, had
taken refuge in Lyons, and been followed here
by many of their faction. In the church of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Célestins</span> they erected a superb monument;
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie de Médicis</span>, on her arrival
at Lyons to espouse Henry the Fourth, visited
the churches of the city, and perceived this
mausoleum. In indignation at finding so
splendid a memorial of those whose ancestors
had been the assassins of some of her own, she
commanded it to be broken, and only a few of
its ornaments escaped destruction. Not far
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Célestins</span> there formerly stood another
monastery, that of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jacobins,</span> or Dominicans.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Humbert de la Tour,</span> last sovereign
prince of Dauphiny, ceded his province to
Philip of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valois</span>, in despair at the death of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
only son, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">André.</span> It was said he had been its
cause; for that sojourning at Lyons, and playing
with his child at a window which overlooked
the Rhone, the boy slipped from his
arms, and fell into the rapid river.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1345 Pope Clement the Sixth
preached a second crusade. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Humbert</span> obtained
the command of this expedition, and
embarked at Marseilles with his wife, who insisted
on sharing his fatigues and dangers. On
their return from the Holy Land, where he
had been successful against the Saracens, she
died at Rhodes, and some time after this second
loss he took the vows in the Dominican
monastery at Lyons, and was afterwards prior
of the Jacobin convent in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010' >The outside of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Nizier</span> has been partly
modernized. Within, it is remarkably beautiful.
We found a procession of priests and
children, who had made their “première
communion” in the morning. The little girls
marched first very peaceably, and looking
pretty, with white frocks and veils; of the
foremost ten chosen for good conduct, the first
carried a silver crucifix, beneath a miniature
tent bed, from whose top depended long
white ribands, which the remaining nine
held. After the girls came the boys, ignoble
looking ragamuffins, not having the advantage
of veils to hide their sunburnt faces, pushing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
for their places, and squabbling for the
streamers in a way not edifying. The male
and female troop joined in the psalm with the
priests and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfans de chœur,</span> making altogether
an indescribable howl.</p>

<p class='c010' >I mentioned to you the votive offerings I
have remarked in some Catholic chapels, but
nowhere have I seen them abound as in one
here dedicated to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ste. Philomène;</span> the walls
are literally covered. Among a multitude of
dolls’ heads, hands, and arms, I noticed a garland
of artificial roses, framed and glazed; this
was entitled, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vœu de Reconnaissance.</span>” A
little picture beside it represented a little lady
in blue, kneeling by a red bed, looking to an
angle of the ceiling, where stood (air-supported)
a saint, crowned, and wearing a gold
petticoat; below, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vœu à Ste. Philomène.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >The grandest of the water-colour drawings
was the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chasse Miraculeuse de Ste. Philomène.</span>”
Its upper part was divided into various
small compartments, each representing
an episode of her life. In the first she stands
before a tribunal, below, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jugée;</span>” in the
second, tied to a tree, stuck all over with arrows,
below, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Percée;</span>” in the third, tumbling
over a bridge, below, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Précipitée;</span>” in
the fourth, taken out of the torrent, and her
head cut off, below, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Décapitée.</span>” At the
bottom of the picture she is placed on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chasse Miraculeuse,</span> finely dressed and her
eyes open, I presume all attempts to murder
her having failed.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux</span> is at no great distance
from the church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Nizier</span>. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</span> forms one side; in its vestibule
are two fine groups in bronze, by Couston:—the
Rhone, a majestic male figure, resting on
a lion; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône,</span> gentle as her own course,
couched on a lioness. The chief interest of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux</span> for us was, in its recollections
of the death of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Thou</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De
Cinq Mars,</span> who perished here on the scaffold,
one like a saint, the other like a Roman.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010' >The weather has suddenly changed from
oppressive heat to the bitter north-east winds
which accompanied us here. I suppose the
heat took leave on the wings of last night’s
thunder-storm.</p>

<p class='c019' >The evening promenade of the fashionables
of Lyons is under the trees of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span>,
and capricious as fashion is called, she
was enthroned here three centuries ago. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louise
Labé</span> was a native of Lyons; from her childhood
remarkable for genius and personal attractions;
at fifteen, a fearless, vain, beautiful
girl. Her father’s pride bestowed on her an
education beyond her sex and century, and an
imagination unchilled as her temper was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
unrestrained by control, joined to the consciousness
of her own superiority, induced her, from
this early age, to seek to rise above her sex,
and laugh at all the barriers which custom
had raised between it and glory. Her hours
of recreation, from Greek, Latin, Italian, and
Spanish studies, she passed in attaining perfection
in all military exercises, and the command
of the most fiery horse. At the age of
sixteen, and during the campaign of 1542, she
appeared at the army. The Dauphin commanded
the siege of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Perpignan</span>, and Louise
disdained to treat fatigues or dangers as obstacles
when distinction was before her. Her
dauntless courage soon made her known by
the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitaine Loys</span>. After the siege,
abandoning the profession of arms with the
same caprice which led her to adopt it, she
returned to Lyons, to cultivate letters with
more enthusiasm than before; for with her all
tastes were passions.</p>

<p class='c010' >Many sought her hand; it was said she had
given her heart while at the army to a young
officer of family, but no fortune. She, notwithstanding,
on her return, accepted a rich
rope merchant, named <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Perrin,</span> whose riches
might afford fresh means of celebrity. In her
spacious gardens, near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Bellecour</span>,
crowds assembled to see her; men of learning,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
poets, and artists. The subjects of their meetings
were science, poetry, and the fine arts, of
all which she seemed the beautiful genius by
turns; and a knowledge of music and a fine
voice were added to these gifts of a higher
order, like the wand to the enchantress.</p>

<p class='c010' >Among those who sought her society was
her friend, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clémence de Bourges.</span> Much
younger than Louise; of not inferior, though
a different style of beauty, of equal genius,
timid as was its possessor. To her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louise
Labé</span> dedicated a volume of poems, and became
in turn confidante of her most secret
thoughts. The one was the observed of all
observers, a sun round which worlds might revolve;
the other, with all her talent and loveliness,
was a mild, soft-hearted woman, content
to single forth “a bright particular star,”
and make it that of her destiny. She was
betrothed to the object of her first love, a
young officer, of the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Dupeyrat,</span>
whose profession often absented him from
Lyons; and during these absences it became
the habit of Clemence to pass much of her
time with Louise in discourse of her lover,
sometimes showing to her in confidence the
sweet verses her affection addressed to him.
At last the officer returned; Louise’s curiosity
was excited, and Clemence was proud and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
happy to make him known to her. Woman’s
vanity prevailed over woman’s friendship.
She tried the powers of her fascination, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dupeyrat</span> was dazzled by the wit which shone
from heartlessness, and Clemence was too
deeply interested to struggle long, for her
hand was paralyzed by feeling her life staked
on the throw. Next she was neglected;—the
friends parted, and then she was alone; and
while <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dupeyrat</span> was following the footsteps
and listening to the magic voice of her brilliant
rival, adding one more to her court,
young Clemence pined and grew pale in her
solitude, but lived on still, for hope had not
quite deserted her. At last <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dupeyrat</span> left
Lyons to join his comrades at the siege of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaurepaire</span>, and while Clemence trusted that
absence might bring back thoughts of other
times, she received news of his death; he had
been killed during the storm. She did not
survive him long, and was borne to her grave
with her fair young face uncovered, and her
head crowned with white flowers, and followed
to it by the regret of all Lyons.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louise Labé</span>, not formed of the “porcelain
of human clay,” inherited the fortune of her
deceased husband, and died about forty years
of age. From the most celebrated of her
works, a kind of drama, entitled “Love and
Madness,” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lafontaine</span> took the plot of one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
his fables. After her decease, her house was
taken down, and a street occupies its place.
It is still called after her, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la belle
Cordière</span>.”</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>27th May.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We are to leave the day after to-morrow,
and our friend spent last evening with us. He
told us a story, which, though it certainly has
nothing to do with Lyons, I cannot forbear
telling you, who have no chance of hearing it
from himself. You know that since we saw
him he has passed four years and a half in
Africa, fighting against Abd-el-Kader. In
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——’s</span> regiment there was a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantinière,</span>
not handsome, but a very stout, robust
woman of about thirty, with a powerful arm,
and sufficiently red face not to belie her calling.
In an engagement which took place between
the French and Arabs, our friend, Capt.
de ——, was at no great distance from the
poor woman when she was taken prisoner. He
was with his men too fully occupied to be able
to assist her, and spite of her screams and
struggles she was borne off to Abd-el-Kader.
When he saw her, he thought of his ally, the
Emperor of Morocco, who is a great admirer
of fat women, and Abd-el-Kader exclaimed,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est mon affaire,</span>” and commanded that the
captive should be with due care and attention
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
conveyed to his imperial Majesty, and offered
him as a present. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantinière</span> was placed
on a camel, and transported to the Emperor
of Morocco.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at her destination, the emperor,
struck with her appearance, fell in love, but
ere she could be placed among the ladies of
his harem, it was necessary that she should
change her religion, and here her royal master
failed. She swore at him;—either he did not
understand, or the interpreter thought translation
unnecessary, or love was deaf as he is
sometimes blind; for the emperor essayed all
means of conversion, and having loaded her
with presents in vain, tried the power of
threats.</p>

<p class='c010' >During this time her husband, who was a
soldier in the regiment, was inconsolable, and
in spite of many of his comrades, who laughed
at him, obtained leave and set off for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toulon</span>,
to the consul, who in consequence made application
for the liberty of the captive <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantinière</span>.
The emperor had become greatly
embarrassed; for having threatened to cut off
her head, she said he might if he would, but
he could not make her an apostate. He gave
her slaves to attend her: she beat them vehemently;
to his gentleness she replied by
oaths. Fresh from the 66th, it was useless to
beseech her to be a sultana, she chose to be a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantinière</span>; so that when the demand for her
freedom arrived, he was rather glad to be rid
of her. The poor woman, rewarded for her
courage and constancy, rejoined her husband.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de ——</span> said, that if he would have
taken her back to Oran, all the officers there
had become so interested in her fate, that a
large subscription would probably have been
raised; but her husband preferred remaining
in France; he feared his rival, the Emperor
of Morocco.</p>

<p class='c010' >We have staid here long enough to become
accustomed to the place and people, and I am
sorry to go away. The landlord’s pretty
daughter is an accomplished singer, and her
good old aunts tell me stories in the hot evenings
on the terrace. The fat civil waiter, Ambrose,
is a Savoyard, and was a private in the
regiment of Savoy at the time when the present
King of Sardinia, then Prince of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carignan,</span>
conspired against the last monarch, his
uncle; and when all the Sardinian troops went
over to the Prince, the Savoyard regiment
disbanded itself and the men returned to their
mountains. I have even made acquaintance
with the young pet donkey, who follows round
the yard for the bits of bread which first won
his good graces. The mention of pets reminds
me of an anecdote, for whose truth I
will not vouch, but which I repeat, as it made
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
me laugh. The Marquis of H——, who passes
through Lyons once a year on his way from
England to Italy, has several dogs of a large
strong breed, favourites to the degree that
they always occupied cushions in the carriage,
till medical advice, in consequence of their loss
of health, obliged them sometimes to run behind.
Mortal enemies to cats, I was rather
surprised, when desired to guess how many
they had destroyed on their way from Rome,
to hear a thousand francs’ worth, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour mille
francs de chats.</span>” Most cat proprietors placed
the lame or infirm in the way of his lordship’s
dogs, and set their own value on them after
the massacre. It, however, once happened, that
an ancient landlady thus lost a large Angola,
an old friend of the family, and, in her wrath
and sorrow, for the Marquis of H——’s dinner
she served up its mangled remains before him
in a basket.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>29th May.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Lyons this morning; our trunks sent
on as before, and our only baggage contained
in the valise Grizzle carries, leaving behind
us, as we crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de la Guillotière</span>, the
splendid <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel Dieu</span>, and the green avenues
which edge the rapid river. The bridge is the
longest in France (excepting that of the
St. Esprit, over the Rhone also); its length is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
two hundred and sixty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toises.</span> There existed
one at this spot in the time of Philip Augustus,
King of France, but it was not then of stone,
and when the French king departed from
Lyons for the Holy Land, in company of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>, it gave way beneath
the numbers who formed their suite, and many
were drowned. The widening of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de
la Guillotière</span>, which has heretofore been dangerously
narrow, is now in progress, and the
usual carelessness of the French, and their
confidence in their quiet horses, leaves for the
present a great part in its original narrowness,
but the parapets taken down. We luckily
dismounted as we reached this part, for a man
pulling a cart entangled his wheel in that of a
heavy waggon, and as the horses were backed
to disengage him, and the assistants swore and
pulled with all their might, we expected to
see them go over. As to Fanny, she started
so violently that I feared being obliged to let
go the rein.</p>

<p class='c010' >However we passed in safety. Burning
weather as we rode through the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg,</span> and
ascended the long hill, whence the view back
to Lyons, the Rhone’s windings, and the mountain
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fourvières,</span> is very beautiful. The
square tower of the latter we distinguished for
miles, diminishing by degrees, seen through
vistas of poplars with which the broad road
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
(the best we have yet travelled) is often
shaded. We lost this prospect as we descended,
but the Alps were visible, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc,</span> a
little to the left, towering above them.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we had quitted Lyons late, and loitered
during the heat of the day in the shade, it
was evening when we approached <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Verpilière.</span>
The deep red clover is in blossom, and
the haymaking has begun; and the dew falling
heavily, the breeze which sprung up
brought with it a fresh sweet smell. The
near hills had become bolder and wooded, and
a ruined castle crowned one to the right. I
asked to whom it belonged, when we stopped
to water the horses at a stone reservoir by the
road side. The peasant only knew that its
name was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vavilliers,</span> and it was not furnished
or inhabited, which is not extraordinary, as
there only remain a hollow tower and outer
wall. The human race here improves as
much as the country, but the villages are still
the same. This one at a distance looked deceitfully
well, having neat houses at its entrance
among clumps of chestnut trees, and I
hoped the Chapeau Rouge might prove one
of them; but the street twisted and narrowed
into an abominable alley with its vile variety
of odours, and there was the inn. The landlady’s
doze was disturbed as we rode into her
yard, and she came forth ungracious and scarce
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
awake. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon d’écurie</span> was at work in
the fields, and her husband she said was by
trade a fiddler, and as he was ill, moreover,
there was little chance of his help, and D—— led
the horses into the barn, while I followed
the hostess across the yard and unpromising
kitchen, and into the street, and then up a
stone staircase, like a ladder, to the bedroom
door. Over the bricks, unwashed and unrubbed,
I picked my steps as if in the street,
and I hesitated ere I laid my gloves on the
three-legged table. There was a velvet chair
which I avoided, and a wooden one, and beds
with dark red curtains so thick with dust and
generations of spiders, that I feared to desire
they should be disturbed; she opened the
window to show me complacently that it faced
the street, preferring the peep down into its
gutter, or opposite into the garret, to the
plains and mountains. There were no jugs
or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">basons,</span> and I asked for them; she at first
looked embarrassed, and then, as if a sudden
thought had struck her, said “Ah!” and
desired me to follow, which I did with resignation,
once more into the street, and arrived
in the kitchen, where, having ejected some
kitchen-stuff from a pan of green earthenware,
she said triumphantly “voilà!” and wondered
when I declined, as it was more “commode”
she observed; but finding me obstinate, went
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
to the crockery-shop to <em>borrow</em> the articles required,
which her hotel did not possess.</p>

<p class='c010' >The next difficulty was dinner; she made a
favour of serving it at the usual prices, and then
I found there was nothing to eat. “Soup?”
she would be very happy if it were Sunday,
but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malheureusement,</span> it was their only day
for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot au feu “à rôti:”</span> there was a
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restant</span>” of veal, she said, and truly it proved
a picked bone rebrowned; a fresh salad was
provided, and a chicken which could scarcely
have been fledged, basted with bad oil; yet
she was so certain we were satisfied, it would
have been a pity to complain. She paraded
before us her sick husband in his black cap
and six pretty dirty children, and fearing we
might be dull alone invited us to the kitchen
for the sake of their company. We found that
politics have some trouble in penetrating
hither, for D—— happened to mention the
disturbances in Paris of the 12th of this month,
and she asked with great curiosity to what he
referred, not having heard of them before.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went to bed on mattresses resembling
ploughed fields with their clods unharrowed,
and this morning, when the horses were brought
out uncleaned and uncombed, she desired we
would remember her house and stop here on
our way back. I sincerely hope I may
never see her face again; we intended to-day
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
(the 30th) going only as far as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Latour du
Pin,</span> but the road was so good, shaded by fine
walnut trees, and particularly after <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourgoin,</span>
two posts from our Chapeau Rouge, winding
through so sweet a country, the day cooled
by clouds and soft showers, that in enjoyment
of them and fear of the inn, we determined on
riding on. Met a load of turf, and a barefooted
girl carrying her shoes—a memento of
Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010' >At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourgoin</span> the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Route</span> turns, and
the mountains rise straight before; a valley
to the right, watered by a narrow river,
bordered by trees, and winding through waving
corn and most flowery meadows, which
stretch themselves at the foot of wooded hills
dotted with habitations, which at first reminded
me of those near Ryde, in the Isle of
Wight, but grow bolder. The rising ground
on the left was planted with vines, and tiny
clear streams shine along the hedge-rows, for
there are hedge-rows here full of elder blossom
and wild thyme.</p>

<p class='c010' >The villages are no longer crowded pest-houses,
for the cottages are mostly detached,
each with its neat garden; and the peasants
themselves are a handsomer and happier looking
race. We generally saw the women as
we passed assembled under the old trees, with
distaff and spinning-wheel, and the children
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
herding the few sheep at the road side, and
neglecting them to run after us, and laugh at
the strange sight. There was one girl of
about seventeen, standing at her door in the
large straw hat worn here, who, with her
Italian eyes and Grecian features, was perfectly
lovely.</p>

<p class='c010' >At an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span> outside the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tour du Pin</span> we
stopped to feed the horses and eat an omelette.
I declined the solitary little room wherein the
pretty girl was raising clouds of dust to prepare
it for us, and chose the more airy kitchen,
where while I waited I might observe their attention
to affairs spiritual and temporal. The
temporal appeared first in order, in the print
hung at the door, of a cock with extended
wings, perched on a dial plate which marked
five minutes to twelve, the verse below warning
pennyless travellers:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c021'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Quand ce coq chantera,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> Crédit l’on donnera;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> Mauvais payeur tu auras crédit,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> Quand l’aiguille marquera midi.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016' >The other print, (the spiritual,) pinned
above the snow-white pillow of the bed in the
corner, exhibited a large eye, inscribed, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Dieu
voit tout;”</span> a great ear, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Dieu entend tout;”</span>
a man spurning a beggar, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“un moment;”</span> the
same man seized by devils, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“l’Éternité;”</span> I
suppose this exhortation to charity does not
apply to wayfarers.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
All the fine corn and promising vines we
have passed on our road, will be unproductive
this year, in consequence of the hail
storms which visited the country during our
stay at Lyons. The ear has been beaten
empty, and the bunches of grapes broken; the
season’s loss in this department is computed
at three millions of francs, and the peasants
are planting potatoes, it being too late for any
other seed. The town of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Tour du Pin</span> is
of course as disagreeable near, as picturesque
at a distance, but the remainder of our road
was so lovely, that we many times found ourselves
exclaiming at its contrast with the
gloomy flats and hills of the Isle de France
and Burgundy; for here we had the chain of
mountains, range above range, which the
snow topped and the clouds sailed before, and
where their view first opened on us, a foreground
of fertile valleys, covered with cottages
and clumps of old chestnut trees, the
abrupt bank on our right, crowned with and
shaded by them, while on the left, where they
border the road also, they form with their fresh
green branches a fitting frame for the prospect;
it would be a pity to travel this road
otherwise than on horseback, on a sunny spring
evening.</p>

<p class='c010' >Recommended by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Pauche</span> to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel
de la Poste</span>, at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont du Beauvoisin</span>, we made
our way thither through crooked streets
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
innumerable. All the front rooms were already
taken. I warn you against the No. 1 on the
ground floor, at the end of a long passage,
with one small barred window, looking into the
narrow yard where the post horses are cleaned,
for it fell to our lot. Having been told that
the landlady was exorbitant in her demands,
I rang for her, specified what we wanted, and
asked her charges. No answer, but a promenade
round me with candle in hand, as it
was dark when we arrived. I repeated the
question when I thought the inspection over.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You have had no disputes on the road, have
you,” said Madame, taking hold of the skirt
of my habit and shaking it, to ascertain its
weight.</p>

<p class='c010' >“None.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Very well, then you won’t dispute with
me; where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is your husband your age?” This time
raising her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flambeau</span> under the rim of my hat,
so as to blind me.</p>

<p class='c010' >“He is some years older.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“How many?” asked the indefatigable
landlady.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can’t tell exactly at this moment,” I
said, getting tired, as I never before saw so
much curiosity lodged in one fat human
being.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
“Not tell; you must know his age; is
he thirty, thirty-five, thirty-eight; where is
he?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“In the stable, and I dare say ready for
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The hint took her to the door, but I unhappily
undid the valise, and she rushed back
to the table and asked what was in it. I answered
rather impatiently, that she had better
wait while I unpacked it, so she took me at
my word, and when it was quite empty said,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien,</span>” and went away. The air was insupportable;
but for this there would have
been little to complain of, for the people are
civil,—the landlady’s inquisitiveness, perhaps,
excepted,—and the cooking excellent. I
imagine the unusual light dinner they served
us might be accounted for, by our arriving so
late; we commenced dining to the sound of a
sweet chime, which was the Angelus ringing
in Savoy. To sleep was out of the question;
for as I told you, the post stables were on a
level with us, and over our heads was lodged
a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commis voyageur,</span> who started at daybreak.
D—— saw his saddle and portmanteaux,
weighing altogether three hundred pounds!
The landlord strove hard to induce us to stay;
we are driven out to breathe. Madame, who
peeped into my room before I was up this
morning, came to inquire, “whether I kept a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
regular note of expenses along the road, as
everybody ought.” Monsieur praised the
excursions within the reach of horse travellers;
but the inn stable, large and handsome
as it is, is choked at its entrance by heaps of
rotting manure, and into it is emptied all the
kitchen refuse. I mounted Fanny in a hurry,
for close to me in the yard were two enormous
tubs of water, into which a man was
emptying (there to take their breakfast) bags
full of leeches, which arrived last night <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
poste!</span> I should think no other animal would
feel an appetite here.</p>

<p class='c010' >Away we went to the frontier. The tiny
bridge, with the French sentinel on one side
and the Savoy soldier opposite, seems a
strange division of countries to those used to
sea and sickness. Here were formalities to go
through on account of the horses. D—— received
back the fifty-five francs paid at Calais,
and deposited seventeen francs duty on entering
Savoy. There is a lovely glimpse from
the bridge of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guier,</span> gurgling along the
bottom of its ravine. We were detained some
time at the Savoy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douane,</span> though they were
not at all troublesome, but the horses’ description
was to be copied; and (witness the wisdom
of the King of Sardinia, or his delegates) notwithstanding
that Savoy is so poor a country,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
they receive ungraciously, and would eject unceremoniously,
strangers who bring English
horses. The custom-house officers were in the
first instance about to bind us to quitting the
territory within three days; however, when
D—— represented that I required some rest,
and asked for ten, they consistently inserted two
months.</p>

<p class='c010' >The road from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pont</span> is very good, and
the country fertile and lovely as we ascended
the hill, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guier</span> wound far below in its
wild ravine. The mountains at every step
grow more grand; the fine trees, which abound,
are mostly chestnut; and the cottages, now
built in the Swiss style, with jutting roofs and
outside stairs and galleries, hide themselves
among them, sometimes betrayed only by a
stream of light smoke. Their gardens are even
neater than in England, and we have a luxury
which you perhaps will hardly comprehend,
in cooling our horses’ feet in the innumerable
mountain streams which sparkle along at every
step. Arrived at the summit of the hill, look
back towards the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pont</span> and France, (an extensive
and fertile view,) before the road turns suddenly,
and the scene, the very air changes at the narrow
road, with its giant wall of rock on the left hand,
and on the other a low parapet, from which
the precipice goes sheer down to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guier,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
foaming angrily at its bottom, and warring
with the crags, which, towering again on the
other side, have opened hardly enough to
leave it way. This is the Pass of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chailles,</span>
very grand, and I thought rather fearful, as
Fanny continually started from the cliff and
towards the parapet. The road, such as I
have described it, winds a considerable way,
and before us, in the space the advancing rocks
leave, were mountains white with snow, which
an old peasant said were those near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Chartreuse</span>.
The mountain wind was chill certainly,
but we confessed it had a “freshness
and life” which revived. The sky, which had
been cloudless, suddenly changed, and the
clouds came rolling over the crags, bringing a
muttering of thunder and then a loud clap,
augmented and prolonged by all the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échos.</span>
The horses trembled, and promised to be
troublesome, and we got on faster; but the
storm had rushed on above our heads, and
settled on the top of a purple peak far away,
before we reached the cottage, which stands
where this wild pass ends, and the roaring
Guier becomes a quiet stream. Fear, I suppose,
had made me thirsty and hungry; I
bought some fresh milk in a clean bowl, and
Fanny sprang aside from a yoke of oxen, and
covered her mane and my habit.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had intended sleeping at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Échelles</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
but, as at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Tour du Pin</span>, the inn looked unpromising,
and we merely fed the horses and
went on to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry.</span> Last Thursday was
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête Dieu</span>, and the wreaths of box, which
only a few feet asunder hung across the narrow
street above our heads, looked uncommonly
pretty. The Valley <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Échelles</span> opened
before us as we left the town. Fancy the long
fertile vale surrounded by mountains, which
enclose it except at the spot where you enter—behind
you and the town they are towering
and snowy, while those which skirt the road
you pursue the whole length of the valley are
milder and green and cultivated, a contrast to
the range of bare and broken cliffs on your
right and parallel to them.</p>

<p class='c010' >In front at the extremity of the vale, which
it crosses like its barrier, is the hill which
terminates it; the road you must travel cut
along its edge and crossing two bridges; the
last so high that the head turns to look at it,
for it arches over a mountain stream, and its
white line seen from below looks like a branch
of bent osier. A gradual ascent leads to it,
and, arrived there, you have no terror left but
much wonder, for fifty paces beyond the road
seems to terminate. The rock is before, and
the precipice below, and you forget the grotto
cut through.</p>

<p class='c010' >Beneath the bridge the stream rushes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
turbulently down, forcing a narrow passage among
trees and stones, and gushing far under the
stone arch into the valley; the loveliest view
of the valley itself is from this high bridge:
you see it terminated by distant snow peaks
and guarded by its mighty frontier of rocks
having strange forms, in which you may fancy
castle towers and cathedral portals, contrasting
with the sweet mild plain below them, every
yard cultivated; the glittering church spire
rising among clumps of trees, and the river
alternately hiding itself among its own fringes,
or shining like a white riband through luxuriant
corn-fields and meadows resembling
flower-gardens; patches of turf under the fine
old trees like dark green velvet, and cottages
which, as you look down on them, make you
say of each—“I could live there;” it is like
the happy valley, only one would not want
wings to fly out of it.</p>

<p class='c010' >The gallery is at no great distance from a
kind of passage formerly used by foot-passengers
to arrive at the long ladders which
were then the road to the valley, a descent of
more than fifty metres; they gave it its name,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Échelles.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >The entrance to the grotto is, as I told you,
but a few steps further; a magnificent project
nobly accomplished: it was finished only
in 1813, for the passage constructed by Charles
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
Emanuel in 1670 was not at this spot; it exists,
and is still visited for its romantic beauty, but
we did not see it. The grotto is blown through
the solid rock, which forms its walls, and its
arched roof, and is about eight hundred feet
long; as it receives no light save through its
two apertures, it was so dark about the centre
that I could see the ground, over which Fanny
trod very unwillingly, only where it shone with
pools of water, which distils through the crevices
and dripped on our heads all the way.
Issuing from it, we found a wilder and less
beautiful road, without verdure or habitation,
winding among masses of grey rock, which
must have a savage aspect in winter, but are
now covered with purple columbine and the
red ragged robin. Here and there we saw a
feeble beggar or young peasant herding the
few sheep or small cows perched among the
crags. After a time these crags are interrupted
by green knolls and brushwood, then by old
trees and cottages, and we came again on a
river winding through a wooded dell, a magnified
copy of the Dargle in Wicklow. The
road thence to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> is varied and beautiful
beyond expression, always good for our
horses’ feet, but sometimes very ill protected
from precipices, which, if not the most terrible
in Savoy, are sufficiently so to break the
neck of horse and rider. Not far from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
is the Cascade of Cous, falling from the
rock on the right about two hundred and fifty
feet. It has no great volume of water, but is
exceedingly picturesque, foaming or shining
as it breaks against the uneven stones on the
cliff’s side, or springs over them and down to
the clear pool at its foot, whence it throws up
a spray light as smoke, and then supplies the
bright stream which passes beneath the road
to the river, which we had followed some time,
and was here still on the left, dashing through
wooded defiles, turning romantic mills and
murmuring down diminutive falls. Where
the road is narrowest, some solitary peaks of
granite stand by its side among trees and
bushes, detached from the crags behind them
like their outposts. We crossed a handsome
bridge and broader stream before we caught
sight of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, which lies embosomed in
mountains; a bold and beautiful view, but not
matching that of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Échelles</span>. Behind the
town, which lay before us, rises a line of fine
frowning mountains—the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beauges</span>; that which
seems to hang over <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, presenting at
its summit a succession of seeming towers and
ramparts like a mighty fortification. Far away
to the left shone the lake of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourget</span>, on the
road to Geneva. The valley is fertile, and
the vines trained in arbours. The road close to
the town has been changed, and as we crossed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
the new broad bridge, the abandoned one
made a pretty feature in the landscape.</p>

<p class='c010' >Entering <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, we rode under the
old palace of the Counts and Dukes of Savoy,
with its high terrace shaded by magnificent
horse-chestnuts, and a still most royal looking
tower, which stands alone, and whose hollow
walls have defied time and two fires. The
governor’s palace is modern, and joins at its
extremity another portion of the ancient building,
which must once, from the traces remaining,
have occupied the entire platform. The
chapel remains, that part which rises above
the narrow street, built in the Gothic style:
the façade has been altered to the Italian taste
and spoiled. We passed before fine boulevards
and extensive barracks, containing at present
three thousand men; and, unlike travellers
worn and weary, entered the town at a gallop.</p>

<div class='c012'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de la Poste, Chambéry,</span></span></div>
<div class='c017'><span class='small'>1st June.</span></div>
<p class='c011' >We find ourselves so comfortable that we have
determined on remaining at least a week. The
weather is intensely hot, the country lovely,
and the cleanliness of the inn, as it forms a
contrast with those we have of late inhabited,
made me start last night when I first caught
a glimpse of its floors. The horses have a
good groom, a rarity also, and a comfortable
stable; by which we wish them to profit,
though they performed without fatigue their
seventy-five miles’ ride from Lyons, and are
quite ready to go on.</p>

<p class='c010' >We have been to visit the cathedral, a gothic
edifice, which by no means pleases me, and has
been mercilessly decorated by Turin scene-painters,
so that hardly a foot of its walls and
ceiling remains pure of flourished ornaments
on a bright blue ground. We remained but
a few minutes, and then found our way to the
château. As, according to ancient custom, it
was built on an eminence commanding the
town, that part of the castle chapel which forms
the choir, a few green trees, and a grey archway
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
way, seem to hang over the narrow street which
crosses and terminates the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de Boigne,</span>
built by the benefactor of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>. A flight
of narrow steps at this place conducts to the
archway I mentioned, and thence to the green
esplanade occupying the space between the
façade of the chapel, the modern palace, and
the mighty round tower. Beyond the tower
is a most delicious promenade, which seems
frequented only by a few students. The
double rows of magnificent chestnuts surround
a small park, or, rather, square field, which
occupies the remainder of the hill on which the
château stands, and commands, on two of its
sides, lovely views. Perhaps the finest is that
towards the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Échelles</span>; we sate some time gazing
at it, for under the thick branches it was cool
and dark, even to-day.</p>

<p class='c010' >Returning to the chapel, we put aside a
very shabby curtain of common ticking, which
hangs within the open doors, and forms a contrast
to the gilding; though where it is ornamented
it is rather tawdry than handsome: it
is worth visiting from the extreme beauty of
its tall narrow windows, painted in gorgeous
colours. This church formerly possessed extraordinary
privileges, and we read a long
list of indulgences appended to one of its
walls. The holy shroud, since transported to
Turin, was long kept here. Its historians
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
assert, that when the Christians were forced by
Saladin to leave Jerusalem, they carried away
with them all the sacred relics in their possession,
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saint Suaire</span> was thus conveyed
to Cyprus by those to whom it belonged, and
Geoffrey of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charny,</span> there purchased it: it
next belonged to his son and grand-daughter
Margaret, who married a Seigneur of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villars,</span>
one of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers gentilshommes</span>” of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>,
first duke of Savoy. During a journey she
made thither, she was attacked by robbers,
and all her baggage plundered; but it is told
that when the thieves touched the holy shroud,
drops of blood distilled from it, their hands
became deformed and crippled, and in terror
and remorse they fled and abandoned their
booty.</p>

<p class='c010' >Margaret was well received at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>;
and when she quitted it they implored her, but
vainly, to leave the relic in their city. When,
however, she was about to depart, the mules
who carried it absolutely refused to pass the
gates; and Margaret, believing the circumstance
to be a manifestation of the will of God,
yielded the treasure, which was deposited in
the chapel.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1553, the chapel took fire; and the fire
committed such ravages, that even the silver
case, which contained the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saint linceul,</span> was
melted, but the flames appeared to retreat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
from the linen itself; and such as touched it,
thinking it would scorch, were bathed in a
fresh sweet dew.</p>

<p class='c010' >The holy shroud was transported to Turin
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Emmanuel Philibert,</span> of Savoy, in 1578, to
spare a long walk to St. Charles of Borromeo,
who had vowed to make on foot a pilgrimage
to its shrine.</p>

<p class='c010' >The clergy and people of Milan accompanied
him to the gates of the city, where he
changed his long cloak for a belted robe; gave
his blessing to the crowds prostrated before
him, and then, assuming the pilgrim hat and
staff, set off with his companions. On their
way they took only sufficient food to support
life, and as they walked sung hymns and recited
prayers. During their hours of rest they
performed divine service, and after four days’
march, they arrived in Turin, and accomplished
their vow.</p>

<p class='c010' >Among those who contested the authenticity
of this relic, the principal was Calvin,—who
reminded his hearers that the Hebrews were
in the habit of enveloping their dead in bandages,
not in shrouds; and gave also a list of
the various places in which are exhibited a
shroud and the cloth which covered the face,
as those worn by the Saviour. He even
hinted that the object of his discourse was not
the same bestowed by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marguerite de Charny</span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
as that had been consumed in the great fire at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, and this one substituted.</p>

<p class='c010' >There have been always great objections
made to allowing the curious or pious to approach
too near, in order to observe the stains
on the linen. Philip the Fifth, king of Spain,
when he allied himself to the house of Parma,
obtained, with great difficulty, permission to
have a drawing taken of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saint linceul.</span> The
reliquary was displaced with great ceremony,
and illuminated by a multitude of wax lights.
The artist remained on his knees the whole
time, and executed his sketch while eight
bishops said each a separate mass at the eight
altars which surround the chapel.</p>

<p class='c010' >Savoy passed from the possession of the
Romans to that of the Burgundians, and next
formed part of the kingdom of France ere
it again became incorporated in the new kingdom
of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the tenth century this last was united to
Germany, and Savoy, then a part of the empire,
was governed by counts whom the Emperor
named. It was made a duchy in 1417,
when ruled by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Eighth; in the
time of Francis the First its southern part
belonged to France; become German once
more, hostilities recommenced between Duke
Charles Emmanuel and Henry the Fourth of
France; and the peace of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vervins,</span> which put
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
a stop to them, lost several cantons to Savoy.
It was this circumstance which induced the
dukes to turn their eyes toward Italy; but
when Piedmont had gradually asserted her
superiority, the emissaries of France knew
how to profit adroitly by the discontent her
arrogance awakened. In 1792 Savoy gave
herself to France, and remained French till the
treaties of Vienna and Paris of 1814 and 15.</p>

<p class='c010' >The founder of the house of Savoy was
Humbert of the White Hands, who died
about 1048, and was buried before the portal
of the church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Jean de Maurienne.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >Peter of Savoy (who was born at Suza in
1203) saw a path opened to his ambition by
the marriage of Henry the Third of England
with his niece Eleonora of Provence. In 1241
he hastened to the British court, where he
soon won the feeble monarch’s confidence, was
placed at the head of the administration,
created Earl of Richmond, and loaded with dignities
and honours, till the jealousy of the nation
being roused by this treatment of a foreigner
he was obliged to return to his own country.
The palace in the Strand, which was pulled
down not many years ago, and called the
Savoy, was bestowed on and named from him.
He died in 1268 in the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon,</span> which
had been built by his order.</p>

<p class='c010' >The most chivalrous of the Counts of Savoy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
and the one of whom the recollection is most
forcibly recalled by the ruins of his castle, was
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Sixth, called the Green Count,
from the colour he had adopted. On his return
from a successful campaign in Piedmont, he
held a magnificent tournament in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>.
The spot chosen was that which at present
serves as exercising ground for the troops, and
fashionable promenade, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vernay;</span> before
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée’s</span> time, who changed the stream’s
course, it was the bed of a destructive torrent,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leysse</span>, which now flows calmly, hid in its
deep channel, far under an alley of plane
trees. Opposite this alley, I mean on the
other side of the Champ de Mars, is the ancient
grove of tall thick trees, the favourite
walk of the inhabitants of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>: all
round are mountains, near and distant, green,
or barren, or snowy; whose variety of colouring
is increased by what painters call accidents
of light, which, caused by their position and
the clouds they attract, alter and add to their
beauty every moment. It was here that the
lists were prepared in 1347 or 48; the city was
crowded with the fair and the noble, who came
as spectators or sharers in the festival: the
tournament was to last three days. There
were nineteen champions, the chief among
them young <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> himself; and the first day
they entered the ground prepared for them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
each knight on his war-horse, and by his side
the lady, whose colours he wore, mounted on
a lively steed, and holding in her hand the end
of a slight silken string with which she led her
champion. Count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> appeared in green;
the plumes of his helmet, his surcoat, the
housings of his charger, the dresses of his
squires and pages were all green. He bore
away the praises of all, and in remembrance of
that day thenceforth adopted the colour, and
was called the Green Count.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1365, the Emperor Charles the
Fourth, desiring to return to his own states,
prayed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> to grant him a safe reception
and passage in his lands. The count held
himself highly honoured, and conducted the
emperor to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, with all due solemnities.
Near the old palace had been raised on
a high scaffolding a throne; and on it sat
Charles the Fourth, surrounded by his court,
and wearing the insignia of empire.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>, richly dressed and nobly
mounted, and preceded by six horsemen on
beautiful palfreys, each of whom carried a
banner, rode within the gate of the castle, and
dismounted at the steps of the imperial throne.
The first of the banners was that of St. Maurice;
the second, that of his ancestors, a black
eagle on a golden field; the third bore the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
arms of the marquisate of Susa; the fourth,
those of the duchy of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chablais;</span> the fifth,
those of the duchy of Aosta; the sixth, exhibited
the silver cross, adopted by himself as
his own arms. Two and two after him followed
his barons; each bearing a pennon, on which
shone the white cross. The rest of the nobility
came in like manner on horseback, filling and
surrounding the space. Arrived before the
steps, they dismounted, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> ascended
alone, and kneeling before his majesty did
homage as his vassal. The emperor invested
him with all his honours and dignities one by
one,—that is to say, that, one after the other,
he returned to the count’s hands those banners
he presented.</p>

<p class='c010' >The emperor’s people next took them, and
tearing them, cast them to the ground, according
to custom; excepting only the banner which
bore the silver cross: for the count requested
of the emperor that he would not desire the
ceremony, as regarded this last, should be
accomplished, saying, “it never had sunk to the
earth, and never should, with the help of God.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The homage offered, the count entertained
the emperor at a splendid banquet in the great
hall of the castle. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> and his barons
mounted on tall chargers, bearing the viands,
served his imperial majesty: the greater part
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
of the meats were gilded, and, among other
curiosities, there was a fountain which night
and day cast forth red and white wine.</p>

<p class='c010' >The above account is extracted from the
Chronicle of Savoy by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Guglielmo Paradino.</span>
Pity the old hall is down. A memorial of the
tournament long remained: the names, arms,
and devices of the champions had been painted
on the cathedral walls, but the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carmélites</span>
whitewashed them!!</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1366, when the pope had preached
another crusade to succour the Greek empire,
and many had promised aid but held back
when came the time for performance, the Green
Count, still the flower of chivalry, alone kept
faith; with his own funds equipped at Venice
a considerable number of galleys, and embarked
with his army of cavalry and infantry,
crossbowmen and archers. An ancient chronicle
describes the pomp and ceremonial of
this embarkation. By order of Count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>,
the chiefs of his army and his horsemen were
dressed in doublets of green velvet, richly
embroidered, and himself attired in like manner,
walked from his hostelry to his galley,
followed by his barons, two and two, and preceded
by music: the sounds of the multitudinous
instruments often drowned in the voices
of crowds pressing to see him, and shouting
“Savoy! Savoy!” while to the flourish of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
trumpets, the count ascended his vessel, raised
anchor, and made all sail for Corinth.</p>

<p class='c010' >At Gallipoli he planted his banner,
notwithstanding an obstinate defence—went
thence to Constantinople, where he was received
by the Empress Mary of Bourbon, who
wrote of him, “the presence of the Green
Count <em>alone</em> is worth two thousand lances;”—and
departed from her to prosecute his victories,
and deliver from captivity the Emperor
John Paleologo. He died of plague in 1383.</p>

<p class='c010' >His son <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Seventh, called the
Red Count from the colour he adopted, succeeded
his father, aged three-and-twenty. He
resembled him in chivalrous disposition, and
was looked upon as the model of knights when
with seven hundred Savoyard lances he went
to aid the king of France, Charles the Sixth,
in his war against the English and Flemish,
and praised as most “frank in manner and
fortunate in arms.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Returned from the wars, he had gone to
hunt in the forest of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lornes,</span> which lies on the
shores of the lake of Geneva, below <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thonon;</span>
he was aged one-and-thirty; and as he followed
the wild boar at the full speed of his horse, the
animal fell with him, and rolled on his rider.
The count received a wound on the left thigh,
and was carried to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille,</span> where, some days
after, he died. Savoy long wept for him, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
he was generous and gentle as just. His
death following so quickly on the injury he
had received woke a suspicion of poison, but
though many were enveloped in the accusation
which ensued, all were acquitted except <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre
de Stupinigi,</span> the count’s physician, who on
this mere suspicion was beheaded. His innocence
was acknowledged years after, and,
by order of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Eighth, the unhappy
man’s corpse was disinterred from
the criminal’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fosse,</span> and laid in consecrated
ground.</p>

<p class='c010' >Six years had passed since the death of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Seventh, when the report, which
had died away, was revived as the cause of a
duel famous in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays du Vaud.</span> Gerard
of Estavayér was the accuser, and the defendant
Otho of Grandson. The former had a beautiful
wife, and, on his departure for the wars,
Otho, who was sixty years of age, offered her
the protection of his own walls till her husband’s
return. Gerard gladly accepted, and departed
in confidence, unconscious that Otho’s admiration
of his fair lady had alone prompted
this seeming kindness. While he was away,
she attempted several times, but in vain, to
escape from the castle where he held her
captive and abused the rights of hospitality;
and when her husband returned, and she was
once more suffered to seek her own roof, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
revealed to him, with tears, the treatment she
had suffered during his absence.</p>

<p class='c010' >Burning with rage, whose real cause he
would not divulge, Gerard of Estavayér branded
Otho (whose dislike to the late count had been
well known) as his murderer, and offered to
prove the truth of his assertion in single
combat.</p>

<p class='c010' >The place appointed for the duel was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourg
en Bresse</span>, chosen by the guardians of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>
the Eighth, who was still a minor, and was there
present with his statesmen and chief nobles.
The quarrel had excited an interest which
brought crowds from all countries to witness
its issue. The adversaries were matched in
hatred; unequal in strength and age, for Otho
had been ill, though he disdained on that
account to refuse the challenge or defer the
combat. Arrived in the lists, he spoke aloud
to the assembly; recalling to the memories of
all there that the particulars of the Red Count’s
death had already been brought before them
in the course of a solemn trial, which had in
no manner stained his own honour.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nobles of Savoy,” he exclaimed, “relatives
and vassals of the reigning house, if I have
done this deed, why have you left retribution
to Gerard of Estavayér? he is a false liar;
be it the worse for him as it is well for me.”
The young Count of Savoy rose and made the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
sign of the cross. “In the name of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,” he said, “let the signal
be given, and God show the right!”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was the 7th of August, 1397: the two
champions met in the lists, each armed with
a lance, two swords and a dagger, and a terrible
fight ensued, till Otho, weak from his sickness
and advancing in years, fell beneath the strokes
of his young and vigorous adversary. According
to the justice of the time, he was declared
guilty, and the castle and lands of
Grandson seized by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> of Savoy. His
marble tomb is in the cathedral of Lausanne.
The armed figure lies couched on it, but the
hands are cut off; for thus were represented
those vanquished in judicial combat.</p>

<p class='c010' >This same <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>, whose life had been a
series of successes, and who, according to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Olivier de la Marche,</span> his contemporary, so
ruled his states, that in the midst of those
which were a prey to foreign war and civil
dissensions, there only were found safety,
wealth, and happiness; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>, for whose
sake the Emperor Sigismund had created the
county of Savoy duchy, abdicated in the year
1434. The causes assigned for this weariness
of the world’s honours, in whose pursuit he had
been ardent heretofore, were the loss of a wife
to whom he was tenderly attached, Mary of
Burgundy, who died at Turin of the plague,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
and an attempt made on his life by a nobleman
who had been his friend. He had founded
some years before an Augustine monastery at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span>, half hidden in the forest which
covers the tongue of land advancing into the
lake near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thonon</span>. Repairing thither in the
year 1434, he summoned the principal prelates
and nobles of those dominions which called
him master, and seated on a throne, his sons
Louis and Philip at his side, and Humbert
bastard of Savoy at his feet, and the two
marshals of the duchy present, he spoke at
length concerning all that had been done
since his accession to the dukedom, and concluded
by informing them of the resolution
which was to wake the wonder of Europe.
Calling Prince Louis near, he bade him kneel
down and conferred on him the order of knighthood.
Binding on his sword and embracing
him according to the custom of the time, he
formally created him Prince of Piedmont and
viceroy over his dominions, exhorting him to
protect the church, preserve friendship with
relative and ally, to administer impartial justice,
and, above all, to keep faith inviolably.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was his express command that, in all important
negotiations, Louis should resort to
himself for counsel. He next bestowed on
Philip the title of Count of Geneva, which
was that his brother had held before, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
dismissing the illustrious assembly, he retired
to his apartments with six knights—men in the
decline of life, who had heretofore shared with
him the cares of government, and now chose
to be companions of his solitary life. The
day following, he and they in the church of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span> took the hermit’s garb from the
hands of the Augustine prior. They neither
shaved their heads nor beards, their dress was
a tunic of fine grey cloth, and a scarlet cap,
above which, like the antique hermits, they
wore a cloak with a cowl. They carried the
pilgrim’s staff, and the only tokens of their
primitive grandeur were golden belts and
crosses. Thus was instituted the knightly
order of St. Maurice: the necessary requisites
were noble birth and an exemplary life, and
the number of its votaries could not exceed
seven, including the president; it is believed
that of those he selected thus, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> determined
to form the secret council of his states
during his own life. They remained five
years in the quiet of a retirement, which some
thought more devoted to politics than religion;
while others attributed his abdication to the
prediction of an astrologer which promised him
the tiara.</p>

<p class='c010' >Be this as it may, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> retained the
ducal power beneath the hermit’s cowl. He
was author of the famous peace of Arras and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
its mediator; freeing France from the presence
of the English, and closing their long
discords. In 1439, the fathers of the council
of Bâle, who had deposed Pope Eugenius the
Fourth, elected in his place the retired sovereign;
twenty-four prelates, at whose head
was the Cardinal of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arles</span>, bore their decree to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span>. Unwilling to create a schism in the
church, it is said that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> refused and
burst into tears, and that his resolution was
changed by the eloquence of the messengers,
who proved to him, that on his acceptance depended
the reform of the church and the well-being
of the faithful. In the same chapel of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span> they clothed him in the papal robes
and saluted the first duke of Savoy as Felix
the Fifth. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thonon</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span> barely sufficed
to lodge the ambassadors who came from
all parts to tender him homage. He held
his court in Geneva, but in 1447, Eugenius
the Fourth being dead, Nicolo the Fifth,
elected by the cardinals then in Rome, sat
undisturbed in the papal chair, and Felix,
anxious to put a stop to the divisions which
brought dishonour on the church, dissolved
the council at Bâle and publicly renounced
the tiara at Lausanne which he had worn
nine years, and returned to his solitude at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span>, and the six knights still living there.</p>

<p class='c010' >He survived his abdication but eighteen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
months, and died in Geneva; he was buried at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ripaille</span>, and a noble mausoleum raised above
his ashes, which in 1538 the Bernese soldiery
broke in search of plunder. His bones were
then transferred to the cathedral of Turin,
where they lie beside those of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Emmanuel
Philibert</span> and Christine of France. The
duke’s tower and those of four of his knights
are still standing; the convent, surrounded by
a deep ditch and strong walls, resembles an
antique castle seen from the lake, and rising
above the oak forest. We returned by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue
de Boigne,</span> a handsome street whose arcades
form a shady walk. Part of the high castle
terrace terminates it at one extremity, and at
the other is a fountain which forms a monument
in honour of General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Boigne.</span> His
statue stands on the column which four demi-elephants
support, and though it is not in the
best taste or most perfect proportion, it has
altogether a picturesque effect. A boulevard
of most fragrant lime-trees leads from it to
the Champ de Mars and promenade of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Verney.</span></p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>June 2nd.</span></div>
<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fanchette</span> just now called me to see the
procession of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête Dieu</span>, this being the
first Sunday following the festival; for processions
are observed here as rigorously as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
they once were in France, though, if I may
judge from what I saw to-day, they inspire
small devotion. A number of little girls walked
first, each troop headed by a nun in her monastic
habit. The children were dressed in
white frocks and veils and crowns of flowers;
the youngest held a crucifix under a tiny
arbour of artificial roses. Long lines of women
followed in white robes and cowls, the foremost
bearing banners and the rest lighted
torches: a bevy of young boys, decked out like
the girls, and of men attired like the women,
came next; and then the priests preceding
the host which their superior bore beneath
the dais. Two of the former carried each a
pole, at the top of which was a lantern; four
others threw up their censers, perfuming the
street (<em>not</em> superfluously), and each time their
office ended, performed a strange movement
towards the host, not a curtsey or a bow, but
a bob; and a fifth, whenever the priest beneath
the dais elevated the host, opened and
clapped close a wooden book to warn the people.</p>

<p class='c010' >When the dais was stopped at the end of
the street that the benediction might be given,
it would have been an imposing sight to see
the white robed figures who lined it, and the
people before their doors all kneeling, if one
could for a moment have supposed them more
attentive than absolutely necessary to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
show; but they were talking and looking
about and thrusting their torches in the faces
of their acquaintances. These white ladies
and gentlemen belong to no religious order, but
merely to a society; they are mostly peasants,
and when a procession takes place, their services
are required. At one time, the seeming
penitents left an undue space between their
companies, and the priest who marshalled
them came up in loud anger scolding and
driving. The alarm disconcerted the poor
women, and running to make up for lost time,
they broke their ranks and could not form
them again, and there was a thorough rout.</p>

<p class='c010' >Although I acknowledge I feel small interest
in Rousseau, yet hearing that the walk
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charmettes</span> was one of the prettiest
within our reach, we went thither this afternoon,
passing on our way <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Buisson,</span> the residence
of the late General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Boigne,</span> which is
beautifully situated, and at the very gates of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, its park filled with fine trees, and
ornamented by a picturesque tower. A steep
path leads up the hill to a lane shaded by old
chestnut trees, which cover the banks on each
side and completely exclude the mountain
view, or indeed any but of themselves and the
little brawling rivulet. In this an old woman
was washing, and we asked her where stood
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Charmettes</span>: “Oh,” said she, “you are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
going to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Jacques’</span> house, there it is,”
and she pointed out an unpicturesque mansion
built on the high ground to our right. Continuing
to climb over rough paths and through
a wood, we fancied we were conquering a
mountain, but found, when arrived breathless,
that we were merely at the top of the low hill,
which scarcely seems one looking at it from
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>. From the little plain all over
wild flowers, we had a view of the glittering
city (for the tin, of which they make so liberal
use on roofs and church-spires, never rusts
in this climate), and a lovely prospect of the
country round and beyond it to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont du
Chat</span> and the lake of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourget.</span> While we were
admiring it, the rain commenced; we fortunately
found an ancient tree, whose charitable
old age had provided a hollow trunk,
which served for mansion during two wearisome
hours while the shower fell pitilessly, and
the fog hid every object within twenty feet of
us; at last however it ceased, and as, during
our imprisonment, we had listened to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> clocks, and were aware the dinner
hour was nigh at hand, I advised making a
short cut instead of returning by the way we
came. We went on rapidly, and the road
looked auspiciously for a time till it grew
steep, and we had some difficulty in clambering
among trees and clinging to them, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
when the point and the contemplated short
cut seemed attained, we took one step more
and arrived in the bed of one of the million
streams which spring everywhere: very clear
and very bright, but considerably above our
ankles.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>June 4th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Our mode of travelling throws us very
much for resource on the agreeability of such
companions as chance procures, and we sometimes
make amusing and cordial acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c010' >Among these are an old officer of the empire
and a young abbé from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montelimart.</span>
The day on which the latter arrived was a fast,
and there were at table two English gentlemen,
who (either wilfully in bad taste, or not
wilfully in bad French) made remarks and
asked questions which embarrassed the poor
priest, who is a well-informed, mild-mannered
man. By attempting to soften them down or
explain them away, we became acquainted,
and you would have smiled to see our intimacy
this evening, sitting in the yard in the starlight,
as the stifling heat renders the house
insupportable. The abbé has a leave of four
months, which he employs in travelling,
and enjoys like a boy, after the mournful
duties of his profession. The old officer speaks
with contempt of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fanfaronnades of la jeune
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
France;</span> and the priest with horror of the increasing
immorality of French literature, and
its spreading influence. “If you heard what
I hear,” he said, alluding to confession, “you
would tremble—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la France est malade, bien
malade.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >This morning, when I was wakened as usual
by the parrot screaming in the yard, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">As-tu
déjeûné, Jacot, oui, oui, oui,</span>” I found the
whole establishment in commotion, for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>
had received orders to illuminate and be
gay for the return of its governor, Count
Victor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Casazza di Valmonte.</span> He is something
between seventy-five and eighty, and having
become a widower three months since, losing a
lady of suitable years, he made a journey to
Turin, whence he now brings a young wife.
It is whispered he will receive a charivari,
but the town will hardly venture on so rash an
act, though he is by no means popular; it is
perhaps independently of his will that all precautionary
measures are enforced so strictly,
and only Piedmontese hold any employ. One
of these prudential rules forbids all newspapers,
saving the Gazette de France, to enter
the territory. At the library many of the
books we asked for were on the prohibited list.
The fine theatre, the donation of General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de
Boigne,</span> will be opened next month, but the
repertory is exceedingly small, and the chance
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
stars, who every year in the French provinces
shine and make money, dislike acting here,
where all pieces, ere they can be played, are
submitted to the governor and the bishop, and
none pass the ordeal unscathed.</p>

<p class='c010' >On the wall of the dining room hang the
list of Sardinian laws, and the permission
granted to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons. Friul</span> to keep the hotel,
which must be renewed at the end of each
year, as the leave is only given for that period.
Among the first are some bordering on
the ludicrous; for instance, “whosoever shall
make a noise in the streets at night, <i>sans chandelle</i>,
will be punished.” “Whoever shall
dance bear or monkey, or play the mountebank,
without permission of the governor, &amp;c.”
We rode along the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span> road after
dinner; the judges and officers had gone long
before, and we met the escort and its object
about a mile from the town, but in clouds of
dust, through which and the drawn up glasses
we could scarcely see his thin withered face, and
hers not at all. By the time we got back they
had been received with discharges of artillery,
and were ensconced in the castle, the music on
the terrace, but no charivari; so we went home
to change our dress, and issued forth once more
to see the illumination, accompanied by the
priest and officer. It was a beautiful, breathless
night, and the town and boulevards, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
lighted and thronged, looked well, though it
was true that the urn made of coloured paper
lamps, in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue de Boigne</span>, lost much of
its beauty on close inspection, and the painted
shield, placed under the castle terrace, (coats
of arms and cyphers on a black ground,) resembled
a hatchment, while a silly inscription
began with “Happy those he governs,” which
it seems is not the case, and ends by wishing
long lives to bride and bridegroom, which the
latter has already enjoyed, and seems unlikely
to do over again.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we stood watching, the Governor’s open
carriage drove down the street at a foot’s pace.
The ancient bridegroom was all smiles; the
bride was dressed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Parisienne,</span> graceful,
dark haired, and pretty, but pale, and I
thought sad. The abbé was loud in his indignation
at her self-sacrifice, and continued
his murmurs until we arrived at the hotel.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>June.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >The three roads, to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Échelles</span>, whence we
came, to Turin by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis,</span> and to
Geneva by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix,</span> meet at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>. We took
the Turin road a few evenings since, intending
to ride but a short distance, and were lured on
by its excessive beauty, mile after mile, till we
reached <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>, a road good as in England,
winding among cultivated fields, under
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
noble chestnut and walnut trees and acacias in
blossom. The range of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beauges</span> on the
left, with the vine growing high up its sides;
and on the right, beyond the broader valley, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Granier</span>, whose chain extends as far as Grenoble,
which lies in the hollow. The nearest
mountain facing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> is strangely hollowed
at its summit, in an immense semicircle,
and the ground beneath, for nearly a
league, a succession of dells and hillocks, now
covered with vineyards, bears the name of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abymes de Myans</span>, in memory of the catastrophe
of 1248, when in the month of November
the mighty mass, loosened as if by the
grasp of an evil spirit, descended, a fall of
five thousand feet on the small city of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St.
André</span> and fifteen villages. The records of
the time say, that the devastation ceased at
the foot of an image of the Virgin, called the
Ethiopian, because her face is black, to
whose shrine the devout still flock, even from
the near villages of France. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Friul</span>
told me that, in the midst of one of the vineyards
which cover the buried houses, the top
of a church steeple is still to be seen, the
single tombstone of many victims.</p>

<p class='c010' >Fording a bright stream instead of riding
over its badly paved bridge, we were in sight
of the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chignin.</span> The hill on which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
its four remaining towers still stand hangs
over the village, and the road is henceforth
close to the base of the mountains. These
castles, which crowned rock and height the
whole length of the valleys of the Arc and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Isère</span>, were the telegraphs of the middle ages;
and in time of war, by fires lighted on their
high turrets, gave and repeated signals from
province to province. At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chignin,</span> among
the rubbish of its ruins, was found a heavy
iron collar, now preserved in the museum
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>; it fastened by a secret spring,
and within was furnished with sharp points,
which at every movement made would
wound the neck of the captive, who taken in
fight was detained till he paid his ransom. A
little farther than <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chignin,</span> but a season or
two ago, a large portion of rock fell between
two cottages, providentially touching neither,
and as it reached the ground splitting itself
into a thousand fragments, which lie scattered
among the vines, and are mostly too large to
be moved. We rode down the green lane to
look at it, and found an old man at work, who
said nobody had been injured. An avenue
of poplars brought us by sunset to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>.
The hill stands alone on the plain, a
miniature they tell me of the Righi. Of the
strong fortress which once crowned it, we could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
distinguish scarce a vestige; seen from this
side, it is not a very striking object; to be
aware of its importance it must be viewed from
the other, I mean that of Turin. The road
thither extended to our right, through and
over wooded hills, with the snowy mountains
high above them, reaching to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis.</span> On
the left, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beauges</span> which we had followed
since <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, and before us, as we
stood below the rock of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>, the
valley through which winds the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Isère</span>, seeming
shut in by the white range of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maurienne</span>.
As we stood admiring, a shower which had
long threatened fell over the distant extremity
of the valley; the setting sun was bright, and
the rays crossed the rain which the wind blew
in a contrary direction, and through sunbeams,
and rain, and rainbow, shone the
snow.</p>

<p class='c010' >The fortress of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span> was of extraordinary
strength in 1535; it would have successfully
resisted Francis the First but for the
treachery of the Neapolitan governor. In the
year 1600, besieged by Henry the Fourth, it
was taken through Sully’s fair words and
bribes, his wife being his ambassador to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
de Brandis,</span> wife of the commandant.
Before its capitulation was agreed on, a battery
had been with enormous labour posted on
the rock which commands <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>. Henry
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
was standing there, in the midst of his generals,
when their white plumes betraying them to the
garrison, by a sudden discharge of artillery
striking the rock above, they were covered
with earth and splinters of stone. In the first
moment of surprise, the king crossed himself,
and Sully said with a smile, “Now I see your
majesty is a good catholic.” During this time
Madame de Sully, by her husband’s desire,
had managed to become acquainted with
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Brandis,</span> to whom she made various
gifts, and passed much of her time in her
society. At last, when intimacy had grown to
friendship, she hinted at terms of surrender, to
which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Brandis</span> traitorously agreed, (though
troops were at the time approaching to his
aid by forced marches,) and bore his shame and
his gold to France. Slighted there as a man
marked by infamy, he repaired to Switzerland,
where he carried off a nun from the convent of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bellon,</span> whom he, nevertheless, soon deserted;
and in sorrow and remorse wandered back to
Italy, where he was imprisoned at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Casale,</span> and
afterwards conducted to Turin. His end is
unknown to me.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père Monod,</span> confessor and favourite
of Christina of Savoy, Henry the Fourth’s
daughter, was prisoner in the fort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>.
Victor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>, duke of Savoy, and
Christina’s husband, who had taken the title
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Altesse Royale,</span> despatched the jesuit to
Louis the Thirteenth’s court, charged to enforce
the rights of the house of Savoy on the
throne of Cyprus; and in consequence to
demand that at each audience granted to his
envoy, the regiment of guards should be
placed under arms as for one from royalty; and
also, that through the king’s mediation, the
same honours should be accorded by the pope
to the ministers of Savoy, as to those of royal
courts. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père Monod</span> was, in the first instance,
desired to come to an understanding with the
Marquis of St. Maurice, Victor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée’s</span> ambassador
to France; but, neglecting to consult
him, he acted alone; and, with his natural impetuosity,
insisted on at once obtaining what
might have been the result of time and persuasion.
Richelieu opposed his demands,
wearied by his importunity; and the angry
jesuit strove in return to ruin him at court,
intriguing for that purpose with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caussin,</span> the
king’s confessor, and Mademoiselle de la
Fayette, one of the Queen’s ladies of honour.
The cardinal, as usual, discovered and disconcerted
the plot formed. Mademoiselle de la
Fayette was enclosed in a monastery, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caussin</span>
exiled, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monod</span> obliged to retire from court,
his conduct disavowed by Victor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>.
After the latter’s decease, Richelieu determined,
through Christina become regent, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
be revenged on the rash jesuit; and Christina,
who had refused to deliver him up, saw herself
obliged to exile him to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coni.</span>
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père Monod,</span> irritated
by her conduct, held secret communication
with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marquis of Leganez,</span> governor
of Milan for Spain. He agreed to carry him
off by force and conduct him to Madrid, where
his knowledge of the affairs of Savoy ensured
him a cordial reception. The day before that
on which their project would have been accomplished,
it was discovered,—and Father
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monod,</span> the 8th January, 1639, imprisoned in
the fort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>. The jesuit intrigued
once more, and was transferred to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Miolans.</span>
Christina wrote to Richelieu, “That he had
no longer reason to reproach her, for Father
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monod’s</span> tongue was tied and his person in
custody.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Pope Urban claimed him, through the bishop
of Geneva, as one who could be judged by an
ecclesiastical court only; but while this last
dispute was in agitation, the priest died. He
was a man of great talents and profound knowledge.
It was said that Richelieu’s desire of
revenge was most excited by his having written
a Latin poem, satirizing the mighty cardinal,
rendered by his self-love on all points
vulnerable, who envied the cid, and was vain
of being a dancer.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was dark long before we reached <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
where we arrived but just in time to escape
an awful thunder-storm, having ridden twenty
miles for our evening’s excursion.</p>

<p class='c010' >Yesterday, turning off from the road to
Turin, we rode to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cascade du Bout du
Monde;</span> so is named the fall of the Doria into
the river Leisse, where the latter rushes along
its narrow bed, shut in by high mountains,
which form the base of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent du Nivolet;</span>
and the crags, which enclose the clear stream,
feathered to their feet. We passed on our
way the old castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chaffardon,</span> on a height
to the right hand, and a picturesque village.
The peasantry of this, almost the only fertile
portion of Savoy, are fair and well-featured,
and certainly more courteous than any we have
met with as yet. We did not see the fall: for to
do so it was necessary to pass through a paper-mill
erected here, and up a dirty stair of broken
planks, leaving our horses: not choosing to do
so, we returned through the heat, which was
tremendous, and swarms of wasps and flies,
whose stings made the horses stream with blood.</p>

<p class='c010' >This morning it was cooler, and we profited
by the weather to visit the lake of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourget</span>,—mistaking,
however, our road, and taking
the steep stony one which continually mounts
and descends the range of hills covered with
chestnut-trees, which form a line from the town
to the lake. Close to its shore are the ruins
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
of the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourget</span>, where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the
Fifth was born, and the village.</p>

<p class='c010' >The lake itself, small and beautiful, lies
buried between mountains, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont du Chat</span>
(the passage of Hannibal) on the left hand—a
bare, stern mountain, except at its foot and at
one spot, where a promontory, covered with
old trees, advances as if to admire its solitary
beauty in the clear water. The walls of the
monastery of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hautecombe,</span> founded in 1125,
lie hidden among them. It can be approached
only by the lake or by a steep path on the
mountain side, dangerous except to the natives.</p>

<p class='c010' >The church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hautecombe,</span> thus wrote
an author in 1807, was destined for the sepulchre
of the first counts and dukes of Savoy,
who there raised two magnificent Gothic chapels.
There were to be seen among its many
monuments the white marble statue of Humbert
the Third, who died in 1188; the bronze
mausoleum of Boniface of Savoy, archbishop
of Canterbury, and primate of England, who
died in 1270; those of the fifth, sixth, and
seventh <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>, of whom the last, when he
journeyed into France during the unhappy
reign of Charles the Sixth, defied to single
combat three English earls, and was each time
conqueror; of the Earl of Huntingdon with
the lance, the Earl of Arundel with the sword,
the Earl of Pembroke with the battle-axe. All
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
those curious to learn the history of Savoy
visited this church, which was a chronicle in
stone. In the times of devastation and delirium
the abbey did not escape. A national
agent came to open its tombs and rob them of
whatever precious things had been interred
with its skeletons: the bones were thrown back
into the earth. A year or two after, weeds and
ivy had already half concealed the shattered
monuments and prostrate pillars, and drooped
over the chapel’s broken arches. A porcelain
manufactory was next raised on the very spot,
to profit by the stream which rushes down the
hill from the intermitting fountain to the lake,
but the speculation proved a ruinous one; and
this also went to decay, and the place was left
desolate. It was at this time a popular story,
that the men who, during the silent hours of
night, guided their rafts laden with wood across
the lake towards the Rhone, often saw, by the
faint moonlight, colossal forms standing on the
ruined roof of the abbey, holding shield and
lance, and seeming to strike them in sign of
vengeance. Since then all is changed once
more. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carlo Felice,</span> last sovereign of Piedmont
and Savoy, has restored it to its primitive
splendour—its walls rebuilt—its statues and
mausoleums replaced in the taste of the old
time. It was finished in 1826, and is now
again one of the most interesting sights in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
Savoy. Issuing from the monastery, a narrow
path leads through the vines to a forest of ancient
chestnut trees; an ascent which conducts
to a rock still under their shadow, from a
cavern of which springs the fountain, called
the Wonderful, because it intermits at uncertain
times, and, at each period it flows, ejects
the same quantity of water.</p>

<p class='c019' >Another procession in honour of St. Anthony,
a tribute of gratitude he would merit were all
tales true. I said we had ridden to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cascade
du Bout du Monde,</span> which lies on the
left of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span> road, green lanes and
crooked paths leading thither along the bank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
of the river. Once on a time the rapid melting
of the snows caused the cascade’s sudden
increase, and the river overflowing, threatened
destruction to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg Montmeillan.</span>
In their fear the inhabitants besought St. Anthony,
who was no sooner invoked than the
waters stopped at the entrance of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg.</span>
This day was the anniversary of the
miracle. The street was lined with green
boughs, and hangings depended from its windows;
one of them, opposite our inn, was a
hearth rug on a curtain pole—grenadiers
and military music preceded long ranks of
young girls in white veils carrying lilies in
token of the saint’s purity; but as white lilies
are scarce, those only of the priests, which are
artificial, bore the virgin hue, all the rest
being orange-coloured! A priest carried in the
palm of his hand a small gilded St. Anthony.
Instead of the white-robed men and women,
we had the whole contents of the monastery of
begging friars in their gowns and cowls of unwholesome-looking
brown serge, with half
shaven heads and dirty beards and soiled feet
sandalled—mostly fat, notwithstanding their
condition of mendicants. After the procession
followed breakfasts, their expense defrayed by
collections made by and <em>for</em> the faithful who
eat them in the saint’s honour.</p>

<p class='c010' >Those who make <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> a residence
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
find it cheap and agreeable, as its society is
good and not difficult of access. It is surrounded
with chateaux, many of which are let
on reasonable terms, while furnished apartments
in the town itself are to be had from
600 to 1000 francs yearly. Meat is 7 sous
a-pound. Forage extremely low, fruit and
milk to be had almost for the asking, good
wine 8 sous a bottle. We had a proof of their
being a kindly, unceremonious people. In our
rides we have sometimes met a young lady on
horseback, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtesse de S——,</span> with her
brothers. We were told she was anxious to
make our acquaintance, and that it was the
easiest thing in the world, as we need only
ride up to her chateau, where we should be
well received; but as we are to remain but
some days longer, we are unwilling to do what
would merely be a source of regret, particularly
as we know her history. She is a sweet
looking, fair girl; her family one of the
most ancient and richest here: her father is a
very old man; her mother died in her infancy,
and she was almost brought up by a sister ten
years older than herself, who was, I am told, a
beautiful and amiable young woman. They
had three brothers, all in the army, and were
a very united family. The youngest daughter
was eight or ten years old, when her sister,
who had always been remarkably pious, one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
morning went to mass as usual, but when it was
over did not return. The terrified father, for
her brothers were each with his regiment,
sought for her in vain; she had not been seen
in her usual place at church, nor was she to
be heard of elsewhere. The next day a letter
arrived, dated from the convent at Annecy:
“she had,” she said, “accomplished a project
formed many years before,” and was never
again to return to the home she had quitted,
or the child to whom she had been as a mother.</p>

<p class='c010' >She merely told her resolution, and desired
that such necessaries as she had not with her
should be sent without delay. The convent
to which she had gone was a branch of that of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemenc</span>, and her arrangements had probably
been made beforehand. The nuns, who should
have refused to receive the mistaken girl,
encouraged her resolution, persuaded her of
the truth of her vocation, and rendered vain
the prayers and remonstrances of her heart-broken
parent. He remembered that, when a
child, she often expressed her intention of becoming
a nun, and his sorrow was increased by
the despair of his remaining daughter, who
also determined on leaving a world in which
she felt forsaken. The brothers were summoned
home and opposed her resolution as
they had vainly done that of the novice. The
latter had taken the veil, and her family one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
day visiting her, she received them standing
behind her convent grate, while a nun remained
to repress by her presence any emotions
which might seem hurtful to the weal of
the order. Its heartless laws forbade her
touching the offered hands of her father and
brothers, and they quitted her with a still
stronger determination to save their young
sister from a like sacrifice. One of her affectionate
brothers for her sake abandoned his
profession, fearing the loneliness of her home;
a second has obtained a prolongation of leave
to aid in watching over her till she is settled
in life. She is not fond of general society, but
mild and timid; and of all the amusements she
has been induced to share in, likes only riding,
and passes almost every evening on her small
chestnut horse in her brothers’ company. As
she is rich and sovereign in her father’s house,
her joy and occupation lie in providing for a
multitude of poor people who depend on her
for all—she appears to be almost worshipped
in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >More leeches arrived to-night, post. This
hot weather renders travelling mortal to many,
and as lingering on the road is fatal to them,
we hear that they pay postilions even better
than the English!!!</p>

<p class='c010' >Passing the General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Boigne’s</span> monumental
fountain and the boulevard, and crossing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
the bridge which leads to the Geneva
road, we ascended the hill instead of following
it, and walked to the church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemenc</span>, one of
the first raised to Christianity. The antiquities
found here prove that the village was
very anciently inhabited. When Hannibal had
led his army across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont du Chat</span>, he
arrived hither and went hence to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan</span>,
passing up the valley of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Isère</span> and entering
Italy by the Little St. Bernard. There are
two monasteries, one adjoining the church
which belongs to it, another at a short distance.
I believe the latter to be the Benedictine,
of whose prior and chaplain the Knights
Templar, who established themselves here in
1199, were obliged to ask or buy permission
ere they erected an oratory. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bénédictines</span>
formerly exercised an extraordinary
right, called by a fit name, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Droit de dépouille</span>.”
When in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> or its environs
the head of a family died, the monks received
his best suit of clothes, with which his survivors
were bound to present them; the custom
awoke murmurs, particularly when, in addition,
they claimed the bed on which the deceased
expired. Early in 1400, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bénédictines</span> of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemenc</span> came to an agreement with the Syndics
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, contenting themselves with
receiving the suit of clothes or its price. A
noble might redeem it with eight florins of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
Savoy; a burgess paid five; an artisan two,
and a poor man one!</p>

<p class='c010' >We had been told that beneath the church
were vaults of great age, probably those in
which the Christians of early times assembled.
A flight of steps on each side the choir leads
below. A few rude pillars sustain the roof;
on a tomb lies a colossal figure of the Saviour
sculptured in stone by some unskilful artist
of gone by centuries; it is surrounded by nine
others of like size, which stand in various attitudes
about the tomb. All have been more
or less mutilated, but bear traces of having
been painted long ago. This giant group has
a startling effect on entering the dimly lighted
chapel, and the good people of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>
hold the figures in fear and reverence. The
priest, our acquaintance, told me he too had
visited <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemenc</span>, and not knowing his way
thither, took a guide, a fine tall fellow. Arrived
in the subterranean chapel, Pierre, who
above had manifested no extraordinary devotion,
prostrated himself in sudden fervour, and
recited a De Profundis fast, and tremulously.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> inquired “What ailed him?”
“Don’t you see them, Sir,” said Pierre in a
whisper, pointing to the enormous effigies,
“and don’t you know that you and I are here
alone?”</p>

<p class='c010' >In one of the chapels of the upper church
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
are the bones of one St. Concord, whose real
name was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Couchouars,</span> archbishop of Armagh
and primate of Ireland; his figure is exhibited
within a glass case or shrine, dressed in pontificals,
and with a waxen face and hands!</p>

<p class='c010' >Walking higher up the hill, we passed several
stations leading to a Calvary, supposed
to be very ancient also. An inscription assures,
that whoever shall visit them with due
devotion, gains the same indulgences as are attached
to the holy places at Jerusalem, an advantage
which would save trouble. Beyond,
the ground is covered with blocks of flat stone,
which leave between them no room for vegetation,
and you must beware of breaking your
legs by slipping into their holes and crevices.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went on till we arrived at a giddy
height, hanging over the road to Geneva, and
the view repaid us for our climbing. I forgot
to mention, that opposite the Irish Saint’s
chapel in the church of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemenc</span> is a monument
to General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Boigne</span>. When I arrived
in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, where he is naturally and properly
remembered with respect and affection,
I yet had some trouble in learning his true
history, so that I will save you the like.</p>

<p class='c010' >He was born in this town in 1741; his father
was a hide-merchant, who could bequeath
him no fortune, but bestowed on him a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
education in his native college, and destined
him for a lawyer. Young <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Benoit</span> chose, notwithstanding,
the career of arms, first entering
the Irish regiment in the service of France
and accompanying it to the Mauritius. He
was generally liked, as well for the physical
advantages he possessed, for he was tall and
handsome, as for his character, whose extreme
gentleness contrasted with its fire and unwearied
activity, and firmness of purpose not
to be shaken.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having obtained little promotion during
the five years passed in the French service, he
offered his resignation, and obtained letters
from the Sardinian minister to Admiral Orloff,
who then commanded in the Archipelago the
land and naval force of Russia. Orloff at once,
with the promptitude of perception belonging
to an old officer, appreciated the new comer at
his true value, and placed him as captain in
one of Catherine’s Greek regiments. During
a sortie of the garrison, at the siege of Tenedos,
in 1780, the company he commanded
was cut to pieces, and himself taken prisoner.
Conducted to Constantinople he suffered the
hardships of a cruel captivity during seven
months, and the peace which freed him, also
destroyed all hopes of further promotion; and
having received the rank of major in reward of
his gallant conduct, he threw up his commission
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
once more, and departed for Smyrna, where
he made acquaintance with the French consul,
and also with many foreigners lately returned
from India; and listening to the recitals of
the latter, he felt all the dreams of his youth
and its love of adventure revive within him.
He returned to Constantinople, journeyed
thence to Alexandria and Aleppo, to join a
caravan starting for Balsora, and the caravan
being unable to proceed by reason of the war
between the Turks and Persians, again repaired
to Alexandria and embarked, but fortune
being unfavourable still, he was shipwrecked
at the mouth of the Nile, and cast on
the Arabs’ mercy. Instead of being, as he expected,
stripped and murdered, they received
him with the most generous hospitality, and
conducted him under their protection to Cairo.
Thence through the kindness of Mr. Baldwin,
the English consul, he was enabled to reach
India by the isthmus of Suez, and went to
Bombay first, and then to Madras, where,
being a foreigner, he obtained no employment,
and to earn his bread gave lessons in
fencing, an art in which he excelled. At last
he received an ensign’s commission in a native
regiment in the Company’s service. In a
skirmish which took place soon after, between
some of Hyder Aly’s troops and of those of
the India Company, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Boigne’s</span> corps was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
almost wholly destroyed, and himself only
escaped, because he had been detached with
orders a few moments before.</p>

<p class='c010' >Discouraged by this last event, which rendered
his chances of promotion more distant,
he gave in his resignation, and resolved on returning
to Europe, and doing so by land,
trusting to his intimate knowledge of the
geography of the country, and of its various
dialects. His superior officers, who liked and
esteemed him, furnished him with recommendations
to Lord Hastings, then Governor
of India, and from the sudden change in his
projects and alteration of his fortunes, as well
as from other circumstances, it was presumed
that he had offered his services as envoy or
mediator to the different princes, enemies or
allies, and that Lord Hastings furnished him
with instructions, and also with means of accomplishing
a mission, for which his intelligence
and courage, and also his speaking
their various languages with facility, rendered
him so well fitted.</p>

<p class='c010' >He went first to Lucknow, where the English
ambassador presented him to the Nabob,
Assefed-Daulah; then to Delhi, and at last
determined on offering his services to one of
the native princes, and selected in the first instance
the Ranah of Gohed, who was about to
make war with Sindiah, the most powerful of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
the twelve princes who formed the Mahratta
confederation. Lord Hastings opposed at
first his determination of taking service, and
he was recalled to Calcutta, and employed by
the English once more. He then went to
Delhi, where by the counsel of the English
ambassador, Brown, who himself made the
proposals necessary, he offered himself to the
same Sindiah, whose foe he had almost been so
shortly before. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boigne</span> was to raise and discipline,
after the European manner, a portion
of Sindiah’s army. In providing soldiers there
was little difficulty; much in bowing the
Indian character to military discipline; yet in
the space of five months he had accomplished
the task, and the superiority of his troops was
proved at the siege of Callindjer.</p>

<p class='c010' >From this moment date the successes of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De
Boigne,</span> and the commencement of his colossal
fortune. But Sindiah, who had gratified his
officer with riches and honours, yielding to the
insinuations of his courtiers, soon evinced suspicion
and jealousy, with which he was unable
to bear, and sent in his resignation, which
being accepted, he retired to Lucknow. Sindiah
soon felt his loss, for his preponderance
in the scale startled the remainder of the
Mahratta confederation, and Holkar, one of
its chief members, raised an army to dethrone
him.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
It was then that, aware of his folly and injustice,
he despatched a message to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Boigne,</span>
requesting him to return, on whatever conditions
he might please to make, consenting
beforehand to them all. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boigne</span> started without
hesitation, and had no sooner appeared
before the troops, than his old officers and all
the soldiers came crowding round him. He
obtained the most complete success. Good
administrator as well as warrior, he introduced
regularity and economy into the army; repressed
the depredations of tax-collectors, and
enforcing military discipline, punished pillage
severely.</p>

<p class='c010' >This same year brought him other triumphs.
The Rahjad of Djaipour having revolted,
he marched against and defeated him,
then besieged him in his capital. The
frightened rebel submitted; paid the arrears
of his tribute, and an indemnity of twenty
millions. The General himself signed the
treaty, and made his triumphal entry into
Djaipour, mounted on an elephant covered
with gold and embroidery, and followed by a
brilliant staff. Sindiah believed he could not
better reward such signal services than by
making him governor over these conquered
provinces, with share of the tribute. India was
pacified; from the confines of Lahore to the
sea of Cambaye, all had submitted to Sindiah.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
While the power of the house of Savoy
ebbed from the encroaching arms of the Republic,
and King Charles Emmanuel could only
in the island of Sardinia unrol his standard,
its white cross gleamed victoriously along the
banks of the Indus. The fortunate Savoyard
possessed unlimited power over the Mahratta
states to the north of Cumbul, but a blow was
struck in the midst of his prosperity, for Sindiah
died, leaving the crown to his great
nephew, on the twelfth of February, 1794.
With him expired all hopes of further conquest;
the soul of his thoughts, the motive
of his actions had departed: his “occupation
was gone,” and with a heart almost broken with
the loss of his friend and benefactor, he resolved
on returning to Europe. The greater
part of the conquered or tributary sovereigns
burned to recover their independence. The
Great Mogul and the King of Caboul first felt
of what importance might be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Boigne’s</span>
support, and sent him an embassy, offering the
place of prime minister. Far from accepting
these terms, or seeking to dismember the
states left by Sindiah, he gave his successor
all advice and instructions necessary to their
preservation, and, to consolidate his work, deferred
his departure for two years. These
past, and his health permitting no further
delay, he bade adieu to his brothers in arms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
and started for Calcutta with the regiment of
Persian cavalry belonging to himself, and
which Sindiah’s nephew would have bought,
but refused to pay for till he should return.
Not accepting these conditions, the General
offered it to the India Company, by whom it
was purchased for nine hundred thousand
francs.</p>

<p class='c010' >It has been foolishly asserted that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De
Boigne’s</span> betraying Tippoo Saib to the English
had caused the former’s downfall; but the
Sultan of Maissour’s ruin took place in 1799,
when the General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Boigne</span> had been three
years returned to Europe; and during his long
stay in India, he never held communication
with this prince, who resided at a distance of
five hundred leagues from the country where
himself acquired glory and fortune.</p>

<p class='c010' >He went to settle in England, where he was
well received in the first society, and married
the daughter of the Marquis of Osmond, who
had formerly been ambassador from France to
London; but this ill-assorted union did not
afford the General a day of happiness. Abandoning
the noisy pleasures of cities, he sought
repose in his own country. Large fortunes
are rare there; and in his delicious residence
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Buisson</span> at the gates of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, he lived
like a man of moderate means; and thus,
without diminishing his capital, he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
enabled to make public and private benefactions.</p>

<p class='c010' >His native town owes to him her theatre,
her new streets, scientific foundations, donations
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sapeur pompiers,</span> the enlargement
of its hospitals, and of the Jesuits’ College.
Commiserating the indigent old age of such
as had been born to better fortunes, he
founded a house of refuge, and gifted it with
a dotation of 900,000 francs. Forty persons
past the age of sixty, of either sex, are received
within, and not only provided for, but
treated with respect and care, to which their
earlier days have been accustomed.</p>

<p class='c010' >He bestowed 650,000 francs on an establishment
for the reception of the poor wanting
work, to put a stop to mendicity and its consequences;
and 400,000 more on an hospital
for the insane.</p>

<p class='c010' >His marble bust, executed during his life,
was placed by the king of Sardinia’s order in
the public library. He was at the same time
created count, lieutenant-general, and grand
cross of the military orders of St. Maurice and
St. Lazare. He left one son; the fortune
bequeathed to him was computed at 37,678,000
francs. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Boigne</span> died June, 1830.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>June 18th. Geneva, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel du Secheron</span>.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We took leave the evening of the 15th of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
abbé, who departed for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span>, and the old
officer who is gone to Geneva; and ourselves
left very early the next morning, while the
mist still hung heavily over the town and along
the base of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent de Nivolet,</span> at whose foot
the road winds, and a great part of the road
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span> forms a wall of cliff like, as I said,
a mighty fortification, with vineyards and
châteaux in its shadow. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande route,</span>
which is broad and handsome, is mostly shaded
by old trees, walnut and sweet chestnut. When
we arrived at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span>, which is the fashion and
extolled by guide-books, I was disappointed,
as the mountains had lost their boldness, and
the lake was not visible; nor did I see anything
remarkable, as we rode through it, but
the magnificent trees of its promenades. It is
famous for its warm sulphureous waters, and
for the splendid remains of Roman baths; a
temple of the Ionic order, thought to be
dedicated to Diana; and a Doric arch, raised,
according to its inscription, by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompeius
Campanus.</span> At a short distance from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span> the
country again becomes beautiful, and there is
a grey ruined tower on the right hand perched
high among the woods, and commanding a
ravine and its narrow mountain stream. Some
villagers ran out from their cottages to tell us
that this was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grésy</span>, and to hold our horses
while we visited the cascade, which is near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
road but not visible from it: with it is connected
a melancholy story.</p>

<p class='c010' >Queen Hortense, when sovereign of Holland,
visited it in company of several of her ladies,
among whom was one she particularly loved,
the Baroness de Broc, a very young and
beautiful woman. Too curious and too bold,
her foot slipped as, placing it on the wet
plank, she refused the hand of the guide, and
she fell into the torrent below. Her scream
of terror was the last sound from her lips her
royal friend heard. At this spot are deep
cavities hollowed by the waters in their violent
fall. All endeavours to raise the poor victim
proved vain for half an hour: life had long
departed. A stone bearing the following
inscription has been raised to record her
death:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“To the memory of the Baroness de Broc,
aged twenty-five years, who perished before
her friends’ eyes, June the 19th, 1813. Oh
you who come to view these spots, and hang
over their abysses, beware how you venture
your lives. Think of those who love you!”</p>

<p class='c010' >From <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grésy</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rumilly</span> the road continues
interesting, though less so than that from the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Échelles</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry. Rumilly</span> is a dirty
town: we met at its entrance a postilion looking
for prey, who conducted us to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel
de la Poste,</span> which has just now no innkeeper;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
as he who kept it is ruined, and has lately run
away; and the two servants left in charge, an
elegant mannered young <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“chef”</span> and a woman,
have too much to do, therefore we got little
attendance. The house will soon follow the
master, for a beam in the room where we slept
was so awfully cracked across its centre, that
I commenced speculating on the weight
it would bring down with it; and D——
consoled me by saying it would probably
last till morning! Entering the town, we
passed some traces of former fortifications,
and an old convent, the only one in the town,
stood (the servant said) just behind the tumbling
house. So knowing the localities, I will
tell you a part of their history. In 1630 Louis
the Thirteenth’s forces had entered Savoy:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> and Annecy opened their gates;
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rumilly,</span> more brave than strong, resisted:
the French forces were commanded by the
Marshal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du Hallier.</span> The troops forced their
way, and not until the extermination of the
town had been commanded, did the officer who
gave the order recollect that <em>there</em> resided
three young relatives of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Hallier,</span> the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselles
de Pessieux de Salagine,</span> one of whom
was a Bernardine nun. He sent to warn them
of their danger, inviting them to take refuge
in the camp; but they replied, “they chose to
share the fate of their fellow-citizens, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
would not abandon them in their extremity.”
At this time the principal inhabitants, who
had hastily assembled, decided on deputing
the nun, guarded by some of their own body,
to their besiegers’ head-quarters. She was
beautiful and young, as well as high-spirited
and full of talent. Arrived at the camp, her
loveliness, her eloquence, and firmness, aroused
the officer’s pity: he retracted his sentence as
the noble woman knelt before him, and she
returned to her town to inform those who
waited her in hope and fear, that it would be
plundered for the space of one hour only, and
that the soldiers were enjoined to respect the
houses containing the three sisters, confided to
the safeguard of French honour.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselles de Pessieux</span> employed the
time which was yet to intervene in assembling
all the young of their own sex, and all portable
property of value in their three several houses.
The soldiery, accustomed to severe discipline,
forbore to approach the privileged mansions
containing the sisters, who were called in truth
the guardian angels of their native place.</p>

<p class='c010' >We slept in a thorough draught on account
of the bad air, and rose long before sunrise to
travel on; but to very little purpose, as no one
followed our example. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon d’écurie</span>
after a long search was discovered under the
manger, too sound asleep to be wakened by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
ordinary means. After an hour’s riding, when
the heat was becoming painful, and the flies
beginning their persecution, which both do
before nine o’clock, we missed the second
valise, which I had packed and D—— carried
down, and both of us forgotten. We began by
considering which of us was most in fault, then
we decided the lazy people of the house were
alone to blame, and then we wondered how we
were to get it again; which was embarrassing,
for we preferred losing its contents to travelling
back; but not impossible, for there is an extraordinary
honesty along the road, and nothing
is stolen, though there is often neither gate to
the yard nor fastening to the stable. As we
arrived at the old castle with two grey towers,
which, standing at the road side, is now converted
into a post-house, we met a postilion
who was going back for something forgotten
by the diligence, and promised for two francs
to bring it that night to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frangy</span>, where we
intended to sleep. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frangy</span> is only three posts
distant from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rumilly,</span> yet, when we commenced
descending the hill, which commands a beautiful
wild view of mountains of all shapes and
forms, with the town nestled beside the river
in the Valley of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Usses,</span> we were completely
exhausted by the heat, which was intense.
The steep, unshaded road seems unending, as
it is cut in zigzags on the mountain side, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
the shining steeple at the bottom appeared to
grow more distant as we went on.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the hotel, and D—— with his
horses gone to the stable, I found myself
opposite an impertinent-looking personage
with his hat on, who gave a list of prices which
certainly could be justified by nothing to be
procured at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frangy</span>. As he would hear of no
others, I said “very well,” and ordered breakfast;
which was bad: and we and the horses
being fed, the latter, to the surprise of the
innkeeper, who believed the hot sun would
reconcile us to his dirty rooms, reappeared at
the door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Monsieur and Madame,” said he, looking
doleful, “you shall stay at your own prices.”
“Monsieur,” said we, “you should have
thought of that before: good morning!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The heat, till we got out of the valley, was
tremendous; but as the road is next carried
over the ridge of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Sion</span>, where we had air
once more, and numbers of fine trees, we did
not suffer. Little Fanny, who daily increases
in wisdom, having been stopped beneath them
once or twice, while we mustered courage to
brave the sun again, the remainder of her journey
of her own accord trotted towards shade,
and arrived in it, regularly stopped a few seconds
to refresh herself. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Éluiset</span>, to which we
were bound, is a pretty looking hamlet, of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
few detached houses, but the post-house is not,
as we had been told, an inn; and the two <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberges,</span>
which stand opposite one another,
merely receive <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouliers.</span> We examined their
exterior ere we decided, and fixed on the
Balance, of which beware. The little room,
to which we ascended by a species of ladder,
looked clean, and might, we thought, for one
night, be bearable, though the jutting roof of
the broad balcony prevented the air from entering
at the open windows. There was no room in
which we could dine; but behind the house
was a just-mown hay-field, with noble walnut-trees,
and a mountain view; and there we sent
the dinner table, and agreed we had not yet
had a saloon we liked as well. We passed the
afternoon pleasantly; and when the moon got
up, there would have been nothing to prevent
our going on to Geneva, but for the custom-house,
which was closed then, and not to re-open
till seven in the morning. The valise arrived
in safety, it had not even been opened,—a poor
fellow having brought it all the way on foot in
expectation of only a two-franc piece; and his
hot face shone with pleasure when D—— gave
him something more for his five-and-twenty
miles. You might have envied us our evening,
with the wind in the trees and the moon
in the sky, and the glow-worms shining in the
corn, and the pretty laugh of the children, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
gathered in the hay-field to watch us and to
play; but you would not have envied the night
which was to follow. We went to bed, and I
had been asleep five minutes, when a start at
the other end of the room roused me, and there
I saw D—— sitting upright, the pallid image
of inquisitive horror. “What is the matter?”
exclaimed I. “The devil,” said he; and
glancing at my own sheets, which I praised as
I lay down, because they smelt of wild thyme,
there were the demons, in companies, regiments,
armies. We made a bed on the floor,
and surrounded it by a flood; but the very
floor was alive; and dressing in despair, we
recollected the balcony down to which we
could jump from the window, and there we
transported our baggage and ourselves, and
sat longing for day, and to get into the hay-field;
but the great house-dog lay across the
threshold, and at every movement we made
looked up, and growled ominously. The dawn
came at last, shining on the lake of Geneva,
only two leagues and a half distant, but we
were not disposed to admire. I have seldom
felt happier than when the sleepers were
roused at last, and I found myself in my wished-for
field, and could lie down on the grass,
though it was wet with dew like rain. The
dog came to inspect me carefully, a ceremony I
could have dispensed with; but having satisfied
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
himself I was no thief, and licked my hand
to tell me so, he sat down opposite as a guard,
gravely gazing at me from four to seven. At
seven the custom-house opened, and we rode
away. Beyond <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Éluiset</span> you pass over neutral
ground, which, lying between Switzerland
and Savoy, and subject to neither, is the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contrebandier’s</span> paradise. Exhausted by the
heat, we got some milk at a cottage, for it was
impossible to take anything at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Éluiset</span>.
Arrived at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Julien,</span> where passports are examined,
we hoped to pass through without
being noticed; but were hailed by a red-nosed
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé,</span> and kept broiling in the heat while
it was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visé.</span> Of the road from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Julien</span> to
Geneva I know very little, being at last so
weary, that I absolutely fell asleep on Fanny’s
back, and was wakened by knocking my head
against D——’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010' >We passed through <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carouge,</span> which has become
a town, and has nothing picturesque;
but houses with green shutters and verandas,
and neat gardens, like an English watering-place.
Entering Geneva by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte Neuve,</span>
we rode before its strong fortifications, now
perfectly repaired, (in consequence of the
threats of France last year, when Switzerland
sheltered Louis Bonaparte,) and the ramparts,
which form beautiful and shady promenades.
Near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte Neuve</span> is the botanic garden,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
terribly celebrated; as the spot that it occupied
was that where in 1794 took place the fusillades
and executions which decimated the
respectable citizens of Geneva under the direction
of a member of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comité du Salut Public,</span>
from Paris. We crossed the Rhone, which
is here so deep and bright a blue, that I at
first looked to see whether any dyeing establishment
were near, and then smiled at my folly
in supposing it could act on the rapid river
for a further space than a few feet. As we
took the steep streets pointed out to us as
the shortest way to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte de Cornavin,</span> and
the road to Lausanne, our first impression of
Geneva was less favourable than it would have
been choosing the longer and better way by
the quays and new bridge, which affords a view
of the lake. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel du Secheron</span> is about
a quarter of a mile from the gate on the Lausanne
road. The heat when we arrived was
already excessive, though it was hardly nine
o’clock, and we felt the luxuries of its quiet
and cleanliness. These windows command a
splendid view of the lake, framed by the fine
trees of the park which stretches down to its
shore, of the mild green hill on the other side,
dotted by villas, among which is Lord Byron’s;
and the mountains of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salève,</span> near Geneva;—those
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voiron,</span> and the blue pointed Mole
farther away; and between them, and though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
far beyond, seeming to stand forth before in its
brightness and purity, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc.</span> The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span> is a better inn than any I have
met with even in England, and, notwithstanding
its expensive reputation, is more reasonable,
as well as more comfortable, than the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bergues,</span> according to the account of an
acquaintance we met in Geneva. I do not
comprehend how any stranger can prefer the
stifling streets and their noise to the shade and
quiet here, particularly as we find every facility
for making excursions. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Dejean</span>
supplies the town with carriages, and keeps
thirty horses in his stables, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel</span>
having its own boat and boatmen, we are
landed on the quay in five minutes.</p>

<p class='c010' >Notwithstanding these advantages, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span>,
from being accused of high charges,
and from its nickname of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel des Têtes
Couronnées</span>, has made little money of late.
The old proprietor, in whose family it has been
many years, for his great-grandfather planted
most of its trees, resigns himself, saying, that
if not an inn it will be a country house. We
wish him success, for, unlike his brethren, he refuses
to turn out his servants at the approach
of winter: he never sells an old horse, and has
latterly fed and lodged for some days, and for
nothing, a traveller who had no means of payment.</p>

<p class='c019' >The early history of Geneva; its foundation
by the Allobroges; its increase under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
Romans, Burgundians, and Franks, till it obtained
privileges from Charlemagne, and held
fairs; formed part of the second kingdom of
Burgundy, and passed, along with its other
relics, into the feeble power of the German
emperors, is too long and uninteresting in its
details for me to call it to your mind now.
During the confused changes of these long revolutions,
the clergy had found means at Geneva
as well as at Sion, Lausanne, Constance, and
other towns of the empire, to join to its spiritual
jurisdiction a large portion of temporal
authority; and the bishops obtained from the
emperor the title of prince and sovereign of
the town, and a part of the land surrounding
it.</p>

<p class='c010' >The inhabitants generally preferred his rule
to that of the warlike and turbulent princes
who owned the territories adjoining theirs; not
only because they expected it would be mildly
held, but because their own voices, joined to
those of the chapter of his church, elected him,
and having no military force under his command,
he found moderation a necessary virtue.
Besides this restraint, the bishop acknowledged
others. He could not exercise authority
alone; he was the emperor’s vassal, and the
administration of justice was disputed with
him by the counts of Geneva, who, from being
merely imperial officers, had become the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
bishop’s first vassals. The people, profiting by
their frequent discords, established their own
power, and held fast the privileges granted by
divers emperors. They elected four syndics
and a treasurer, who chose in turn their principal
assessors. They deliberated on taxes to
be levied, alliances to be formed; on all important
affairs interesting the general welfare—so
that Geneva, being an imperial town, shared
the exercise of sovereign power between her
bishop and her citizens.</p>

<p class='c010' >This already complicated constitution became
still more so, when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amé</span> the Fifth the
Great, count of Savoy, strove to become
master of Geneva. The Genevese, fearing the
efforts against their liberty made by their
bishop and the count of Geneva, who was his
brother, had had recourse to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amé’s</span> protection,
a circumstance by which he profited. He
obliged the bishop to cede to him the office of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vidomne</span>, in virtue of which he became judge
(from whose decision there was no appeal) of
all civil causes.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Eighth, afterwards Pope Felix,
united in his person the necessary powers for
following up this project of usurpation. The
count of Geneva had sold him his rights and
lands. Created by the Emperor Sigismund
duke of Savoy, he proposed to the bishop to
cede to him his rights also. A bull of Pope
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
Martin the Fifth authorized the latter to abdicate
his sovereignty, but he was sufficiently
just to demand, ere doing so, the consent of
the Genevese assembly: “Inasmuch,” the
four syndics replied in the name of the
citizens, “as Geneva, subject to the power of
the church, has been governed peaceably and
mildly for four hundred years, it seems neither
useful nor honourable for church and bishop,
but rather dangerous to the state, to admit a
project of alienation. We will never suffer,
while in our power to oppose it, any foreign
domination. Ourselves and our children will
continue beneath the rule of the church, with
our bishop for sovereign, requiring of him,
that, according to his duty and his oath,
sworn at his accession, he shall govern faithfully,
and preserve his right as heretofore,—the
syndics and citizens of Geneva, on their
side, promising him assistance in case of
need, as also to all his successors who shall be
elected canonically, that is to say, by the people
in general council.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The dukes of Savoy who succeeded <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>
the Eighth renewed the attempts made by
their ancestor. They sometimes succeeded in
causing the bishop to be chosen among the
princes, the children, and even the bastards of
their house. Philip of Savoy, brother of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Philibert</span>,
was thus elected bishop at the age of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
seven. Growing older, his childhood was regretted,
for he showed a stirring disposition,
and a love of arms, which led him to sacrifice
his subjects’ repose, and urge his brother’s
taking possession of Geneva. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Philibert</span>, wiser
and more just, voluntarily abandoned the
design, and fixed his residence at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The reign of Charles the Third, who succeeded
him in 1504, was that whose oppression
and cruelty finally roused Geneva. He proved
himself the citizens’ open enemy, attacking
their liberties in every way, and unweariedly.
Seconded by the bishop, who was his relative,
he made various pompous entries into the
town, winning over some few, intimidating
others; seizing the citizens who even faintly
opposed his will, and flinging them into dungeons,
where they perished by famine or
torture.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span>, one of the Genevese council, had
obtained letters of “bourgeoisie” at Fribourg,
as a safeguard from the duke’s tyranny, and
found them useful when, in 1517, having become
involved in a private quarrel between <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">André
Malvenda</span> and a judge named by the duke and
bishop, others implicated like himself were punished
by a light fine only, while he was attacked
with a rancour which obliged him first
to conceal himself, and then to escape to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
Fribourg. The citizens of Fribourg made an
appeal in his favour, insisting on his being
tried by his proper judges, the syndics of Geneva;
and returning thither, he was absolved
by them. But during his stay at Fribourg
he had negotiated an alliance between that
republic and his own country; and as it protected
the independence of Geneva, (the inhabitants
of each town styling those of the
other co-citizens,) the angry duke strove to
conceal his disappointment, and to bribe <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span>
to support his interests by the most
seducing offers.</p>

<p class='c010' >Notwithstanding the peril in which his refusal
placed him; notwithstanding that an
army of seven thousand Savoyards assembled
at the gates of an unfortified town, and the inhabitants
of Fribourg had sent deputies to
declare that the Bernese and the whole of the
Swiss confederation pressed them to break
through their just concluded treaty, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span>,
without a chance of flight or a hope of resistance,
rejected the duke’s offers with disdain;
communicated his own courage to the
assembled council, and the alliance of Fribourg
was confirmed, in the midst of menace and
danger. The first of April, 1519, the herald
at arms of the duke of Savoy, entering the
assembly and seating himself above the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
syndics, declared war in the name of <em>his master
and theirs</em>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Genevese armed and prepared for defence;
but a message from Fribourg informing
them that its army could not arrive in
time to save them, they suffered the duke to
enter their town, this time without his exercising
much violence, for the Fribourg soldiers
had advanced into the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays de Vaud,</span> and seized
on hostages there. Charles the Third adopted
another course: the bishop was prince of Geneva,
and had rights the Fribourg citizens
would not contest. He levied an army in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucigny,</span>
and entered the town the 20th of August.
Once more the friends of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span>
implored him to fly: “No,” he answered,
“our voices are not loud enough to reach Fribourg;
they will hear and they will act when
the blood of a victim calls upon them.” Far
from concealing himself, he every day went to
walk in a garden near the entrance of the
town.</p>

<p class='c010' >The third day after the bishop’s arrival,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span> met the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vidomne</span> on his road, surrounded
with soldiers come to arrest him. He
advanced to meet them coolly; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vidomne</span>
demanded his sword; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span> presented it:
“Keep it carefully,” he said; “you will be
called on to account for it.” He said no more,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
and allowed himself to be conducted to prison
with perfect calmness. The syndics claimed
him as within their jurisdiction; but the bishop,
who with his soldiers held the town, rejected
their demand, and created provost a tooth-drawer
of his suite, to proceed against him.
This new made judge vainly questioned the
prisoner: “I am ready to reply to the syndics,”
he answered; “of you I know nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010' >He was condemned without further trial.
Led forth from his prison to the place near it,
he breathed a short prayer, turned towards
the people, saying, “Ah citizens of Geneva!”
stooped his head to the block, and received
the death blow. The executioner raised it
by the hair, and showed it to the crowd, saying,
“This is the head of a traitor; let the sight
of it be a warning to you.” His body was
hung on a gibbet, but carried thence and
buried.</p>

<p class='c010' >In consequence of this murder, and that of
others, victims like him, many took refuge in
Berne, Fribourg, and other towns, and the
recital of what had passed made, as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthelier</span>
had hoped, a strong impression. Berne and
Fribourg sent deputies to Geneva. A new
treaty was entered into by the three towns,
and solemnly ratified, the two cantons engaging
to defend the Genevese in their persons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
their liberties, and properties. Geneva in like
manner bound herself to assist and protect
Berne and Fribourg, but, being the weaker
party, she was to do so at her own expense;
while, on the contrary, she defrayed all that
might be incurred in her favour by her allies.
The duke of Savoy opposed the treaty strongly,
but vainly. The office of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vidomne</span>, who
administered justice in the duke’s name, was
abolished, and his partisans, whom the Swiss
called Mamelukes, because they said, like the
satellites of the sultan of Egypt, they were
the pillars of tyranny, having retired from the
city, and refused to return, were proclaimed
traitors. Their only means of vengeance lay
in joining themselves to the Savoyard nobles,
who, under the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Confrères de la
Cuiller,</span> ravaged the possessions of the Genevese,
and the environs of their town. They
had adopted the title at a banquet, where,
assembled and intoxicated, they ferociously
engaged to eat them as spoon meat, and since
that time, and in memory of his vow, each of
the brotherhood wore a spoon appended to his
collar.</p>

<p class='c010' >The bishop at this period was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre de la
Baume,</span> an immoral and inconsistent man, who,
having served the duke at the expense of the
citizens, with like caprice abandoned his cause,
and sworn a solemn oath to consult no interests
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
but theirs, broke it ere the year had passed
away, and, on their refusal to renounce the
alliance and restore the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vidomnat,</span> became
their implacable enemy and the duke’s
friend once more. His intrigues with
Berne and Fribourg induced them to send
deputies to Geneva, offering to cancel the
treaty should the Genevese agree to doing so.
But when, admitted before the council, they
had discharged their task, and each member,
raising his right hand, swore rather to die
than consent, the ambassadors felt that their
unanimous courage at least commanded esteem,
and that, consistently with their own honour,
their native towns could not abandon one so
worthy support and liberty.</p>

<p class='c010' >The surrounding country ravaged; the
insulted <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourgs;</span> the discovery of divers
conspiracies for taking the city by storm, and
putting its inhabitants to the sword, left the
cantons no excuse for delaying to grant their
promised assistance. Their army arrived at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morges,</span> while ten thousand men commanded
by the duke besieged Geneva; and, though the
allies were inferior in number, these last, on
the news of their approach, retired in haste
and without order, for they were chiefly
recruits and mercenaries. The Swiss came on
notwithstanding; pillaging all on their way,
and burning the castles of the brethren of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
Cuiller.</span> The duke sent an ambassador
charged to throw the blame of all that had
occurred on the last mentioned fraternity.
The conferences were held at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Julien,</span> and
Charles the Third saw himself obliged to
acquiesce in the conditions proposed to him,
engaging that all hostilities should cease, and
placing in the power of Berne and Fribourg
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays de Vaud</span> as pledge of his sincerity,
abandoning in their favour all rights he possessed
over it, provided it were proved that
he had not fulfilled his part of the treaty.</p>

<p class='c010' >These concessions made, the chiefs of the
allied army thought their most pressing business
in Geneva consisted henceforth in demanding
payment of the expenses of their
expedition. The starved and pillaged Genevese
solicited the patience due to their situation,
yet by an effort worthy them and their love of
liberty, divesting themselves even of necessaries,
a portion of the debt was defrayed.
When the army of the cantons marched from
the town, they found themselves reduced to
seek a last resource in their unshaken courage,
which was most efficient of all. The troops
had hardly retreated, ere the duke again
attempted to cut off supplies, and levied a
considerable corps with the design of employing
it against them. Some time after, notwithstanding
the alliance made and confirmed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
at several times, the duke’s intrigues at Berne
influencing the cantons, they again ungenerously
proposed its dissolution; giving, as a
reason, that the Genevese were not rich enough
to pay for the assistance they would require at
each fresh attack. This proposal was made
in a form painful as was its spirit to those by
whom it was received; for the three deputies
who were its bearers accompanied it with
various menaces; yet the small and struggling
nation, in its worst extremity, bore up bravely.
“The more we may be threatened,” they
replied, “the more will we be firm and constant;
forasmuch as dying for the right, we
will hold ourselves happy. Nevertheless, we
so trust in God and the citizens of the two
towns, believing they will observe the oaths
made in presence of their Creator and fellow-men,
that we will satisfy our debt, even if, so
to do, we shall be obliged to pledge all our
worldly goods, even to our wives and our
children.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was after this that Berne and Fribourg,
having vainly attempted to temporize, and
striven to adopt a middle course, which the
Genevese proudly rejected, returned to better
feelings, and refused to renew their alliance
with the duke, who had failed to pay to themselves
the sums which he had forfeited. The
Protestant religion was now gaining rapid
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
growth, animating the Swiss with fresh zeal
for the liberty it favoured, and deepening the
duke’s hatred, as it changed to a kind of
crusade what had been a mere spoliation.
Though Geneva has since borne the title of
reformed Rome, Zwingle and his associates
had disseminated their doctrines over the rest
of the Swiss states before it reached herself in
1528: for its entrance here grew out of the ill
conduct and scandalous lives of their bishops
and ecclesiastics, and such observations as the
citizens made during the frequent journeys
their commerce necessitated into Switzerland.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span>, prior of the abbey of St. Victor,
situated close to Geneva, esteemed for his
pure life and profound learning, exhorted the
Genevese to reform their conduct and enlighten
their minds, to dare to speak and think freely.
Fribourg (remained faithful to the Catholic
creed) employed threats as well as prayers to
prevent their allies falling away; but the
Bernese soldiers, during the brief time they
had spent in Geneva, had taught the people
to insult the outward signs of their old faith,
to fling down for firewood the rude wooden
statues which decorated the churches; and the
people, finding their bravadoes unpunished,
repeated and exaggerated them daily. In
1530 <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span> was betrayed to the duke of
Savoy, some say by false friends, others by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
bandits, who seized and rifled him on a wild
tract of the Jura; and, delivered to Charles
the Third, he was cast into the dungeon of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span>. The bishop was leagued with the
duke, though secretly, to make war on Geneva,
and the proofs of his collusion were not wanting.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Farel</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saulnier,</span> both reformers,
preached publicly to the excited multitude;
and the little state divided by religious fury,
the hand of the father was lifted against his
son, and brother betrayed brother.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Catholics conspired, and the Protestants
resisted; conflicts in broad day and assassinations
in the dark continued; while the laws of
the magistrates were useless, and words of
peace were despised. At last an order in
council enacted “that every one should enjoy
liberty of conscience, avoiding to create scandal.”
But this species of truce did not last long.
The Catholic priests provoked fresh sedition,
and in the tumult which followed in the streets,
a citizen of Fribourg was killed. Long disputes
ensued, the Bernese taking part with
the townsmen, the men of Fribourg with the
bishop; till the latter, feigning or feeling fear,
quitted Geneva to join the duke, and returned
thither no more, the citizens shortly after
publishing their resolve no longer to recognize
him for their superior. His grand vicar published
a charge, which commanded, on pain of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
excommunication, the burning of all French
and German Bibles. The Bernese insisted
that permission to preach should be granted
to the reformers; and the sermons of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Farel,</span>
delivered in consequence in the church of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cordeliers,</span> attracted multitudes and converted
many. The bishop had excommunicated the
citizens as hardened heretics, and these last
could only procure food at the sword’s point,
when the grand council, after long debates,
commanded that the celebration of mass should
cease in the city till <em>further</em> orders.</p>

<p class='c010' >An edict ordained that God should be served
according to the rules of the Gospel, and that
all acts of papistical idolatry should be interdicted
for ever.</p>

<p class='c010' >Geneva was again besieged in 1535, and
reduced to the last extremity, when Francis
the First, king of France, not that he hated
the heretics less, but that he hated Savoy
more, offered assistance to the Genevese on
condition of their putting him in possession
of the rights their bishop had held. They
rejected his proposals, saying, “They had
suffered all things in the cause of freedom,
and recommended it to his generosity.”</p>

<p class='c010' >A few levies of troops were consequently
made in France; but the Savoyards closed the
passage to Geneva, while the duke declared
“he would never permit the Genevese to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
change their religion without permission of the
pope; and also, that his nobility, of whom he
was in this instance master, was determined on
sacrificing life and land to exterminate the
Lutherans.” Under these circumstances, and
also because an ally of the duke’s had made
violent inroads on the Bernese possessions,
Berne, aroused at last, declared war against
Savoy,—representing in her manifesto as sole
reason for so doing the “oppression of Geneva,
with which it was impossible to bear longer;
her own honour being interested in protecting
a people persecuted for their common
religion,—as to abandon her ally would
cast upon herself an ineffaceable stain.”</p>

<p class='c010' >As the Bernese army came on, the ducal
troops fled. Advancing unresisted, the former
burned the castles of the brotherhood of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Cuiller,</span> and, entering Geneva, brought with
their presence the term of its sufferings and
long perplexities. Francis the First, reviving
a former claim made on the death of Francesco
Sforza, duke of Milan, despatched at this time
(1536) an army to invade the Milanese territory,
which on its march occupied <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bresse</span> and
a great part of Savoy. His alliance was
offered to Berne and accepted, and the unfortunate
duke lost to France, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bresse</span>, Turin, and
Piedmont, as well as almost all which remained
to him of Savoy. The Bernese were wanting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
in generosity once more. Their gain in booty
and increase of territory had been great: the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays de Vaud,</span> with little pains, had become
theirs; yet they demanded of the Genevese, as
theirs by <em>conquest</em>, the rights and revenues of
their duke and bishops. The Genevese answered
proudly:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“If we could have borne the yoke of a
master, we could have spared ourselves the
struggles and expenses our liberty has cost; we
will not lose the fruit of them. We conjure
you, who aided us in its maintenance, not to
persist in a demand which tarnishes your glory:
by all reasonable means we will strive to repay
your services.”</p>

<p class='c010' >A treaty made greatly to Berne’s advantage—9,917
golden crowns paid ere the close of the
year—the cession of all which Geneva had conquered
from Savoy, kept this promise. Henceforth
free, the citizens profited by the long
wished-for calm to establish order and purity
of conduct, to found hospitals and colleges, and
a short space of time saw an immoral, superstitious,
and ignorant population replaced by one,
industrious, serious to austerity, addicted to
trades, arts, and sciences, in all which their
success became remarkable. The Bernese
army, on its march from Geneva, took <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morges</span>
and Vevey, and besieging <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon,</span> became
masters of this last spot of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays de Vaud</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
owned by Savoy, and delivered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span>,
who had lain in its dungeons six long years.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1536 Calvin appeared in Geneva. Born
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noyon</span> in Picardy, in 1509, and a cooper’s
son, he had been destined for the church, and,
through the protection of an abbé of his native
town, had interest and patrons, which ensured
advancement; and before he had taken orders,
or attained the age of twenty, he owned titles
and revenues attached to several benefices.
While pursuing his ecclesiastical studies in
Paris, he became acquainted with a young
man born, like himself, at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noyon</span>, and his
senior by only a few years. The reformed
religion was making progress in France, and
Olivetan first instilled into his mind the seed
which was to spring up a giant tree. He
abandoned the study of theology, intending to
adopt that of the law; but in consequence of
an harangue pronounced at the university, full
of the new doctrines, and of which he was
believed the composer, he was obliged to fly
from Paris, and during the concealment and
wanderings, which lasted some months, he
patiently continued his researches, and sometimes
left his retreat to preach, in public, sermons
extraordinary for their success and power.
He was well received at the court of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marguerite
de Navarre,</span> sister of Francis the First, who
at that time, rather with a view to please Rome
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
than from hatred to heresy, had lighted, from
one end of his kingdom to the other, the funeral
piles of the reformers; and, to conciliate his
allies, the protestant princes of Germany,
spread abroad pamphlets, in which it was asserted
that the men so rigorously treated belonged
not to those sectarians, but to “the
anabaptists, enemies of all order as well as of
all religion.” In his famous work published as
their confession of faith, “The Christian
Institution,” he refuted the assertions of Francis,
respecting the unfortunate victims of his
policy; while entering into the subject more
clearly and fully than any reformer had yet
done, he attacked Rome in all her entrenchments.
After its publication he went to Ferrara,
and was well received by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse
Renée</span> of France, Louis the Twelfth’s daughter,
who afterwards became protestant. Remaining
there but a short time, he preached in
various towns of Italy, and, discovered in
this employment, was obliged to depart in
all haste, to ensure his own safety. He
returned to Paris, and finding his life endangered
by a sojourn there also, he arrived in
Geneva, where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Farel</span> had for some months
borne the whole weight of the affairs of his
church, and requested assistance, as unable to
continue his labour alone. Become his coadjutor,
and leaving to him the care of preaching,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
he almost entirely consecrated his time to
instruction. He determined on reforming the
lives as well as the doctrine of the citizens,
and commencing this great work with too much
promptitude and severity, he roused powerful
enemies,—and the faction, profiting by the
first favourable moment, demanded and obtained
his exile a little less than two years
after his coming. He retired first to Berne,
and thence to Strasburg, where welcome and
distinction waited him: he was regretted at
Geneva, and implored to return. Calvin objected
his engagements made with Strasburg;
but deputies were despatched to the magistrates
of this town, begging his restoration to
his first flock. His sentence of banishment was
unanimously revoked in the public assembly of
citizens, and in September, 1541, he re-entered
the city. Thenceforward, to the close of his
life, his iron authority was undisputed;
dancing, light songs, festivals,—pleasures
which had always been considered innocent,
were strictly forbidden. He, shortly after his
arrival, presented in council his proposed
changes in ecclesiastical discipline. They
were adopted in the following November. In
consequence of one of these was instituted a
tribunal, called a Consistory, its members half
clerical, half laymen, charged with watching
over the maintenance of pure doctrine and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
moral conduct. Its power of censure extended
to the most trivial words and actions.
No citizen, by his important functions, could be
raised above it, or could be sheltered from its
reprimands, and the shame of seeing them inscribed
on its registers. This new police rendered
Calvin master of the occupations as well
as the opinions of the Genevese; and as he
reigned sovereign in the council to which it
referred, as well as in the consistory, the
judges pronounced condemnation on all who
were opposed to him.</p>

<p class='c010' >A magistrate was condemned to two months’
imprisonment for <em>irregular life and connexion
with Calvin’s enemies</em>; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jacques Gruet</span> to
decapitation for writing impious letters and
libertine rhymes. The darkest stain on Calvin’s
memory is the death of Michael <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span>. Born
the same year with Calvin, but a Spaniard
and destined for the law, he came to Paris
early in life for the sake of studying there; but
soon abandoning this profession, and also that
of medicine afterwards adopted, he abandoned
himself to theological dispute, and became,
though not denying the divinity of Christ, a
violent anti-trinitarian. Having taken up the
trade of corrector of the press, he made his
occupation subservient to his favourite idea, and,
entrusted with a reimpression of the Bible,
he added a preface and notes, which Calvin
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
attacked as <em>impertinent</em> and <em>impious</em>. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span>
entered into correspondence with him, making
use of his talents and learning only to embarrass
his adversary, till the paper war grew so
violent, that the letters on either side changed
to a series of invective. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span> vowed to humiliate
his rival, and shortly after brought out a
work, whose sole purpose was to call attention
to a number of errors he had detected in those
of Calvin, above all in his greatest and most
valued one, “The Christian Institution.”
The reformer was so irritated, that he wrote to
his brethren, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Farel</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Viret,</span> “If ever this
heretic falls into my power, my influence with
the magistrates shall be used for his destruction.”</p>

<p class='c010' >From that moment he held no communication
with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span>, and the latter, occupied with
his system only, spent four years in the compilation
of another work attacking the doctrine
of the Trinity. It was printed at Vienna,
without the author’s or printer’s name; but
Calvin, recognising with the opinions the style
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span>, and finding his own writings and
himself treated with contempt and bitterness,
vowed vengeance on him.</p>

<p class='c010' >Using unworthy means, he sent to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cardinal de Tournon,</span> then archbishop of
Lyons, and the most violent foe of the reformed
faith, some sheets of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet’s</span> treatise:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
and the archbishop communicating them to
the governor-general of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dauphiné,</span> he made
every possible effort to discover from what
press they had issued, but in vain; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span>
would have escaped had not Calvin expedited
to Lyons the originals (of which he had obtained
possession) of some letters contained in
the work; affording proof positive of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet’s</span>
being its author.</p>

<p class='c010' >He was arrested in consequence, and would
have been condemned and executed had he
not found means to escape from prison.
Anxious only to flee from France and to Italy,
where he hoped to live unknown, he did not
reflect that his shortest road might also prove
the most perilous, and, without fear of the
consequences, he arrived in Geneva. Made
acquainted with his flight, but not with its
direction, Calvin’s activity tracked his foe,
and, at his demand, he was arrested. The
city laws ordained that the accuser should
share the prison of the accused, but not
choosing to submit to them, this part devolved
on one <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lafontaine</span>, said to be his valet, while
he reserved to himself that of discussing the
theological question. In the outset <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span>
appeared calm and unembarrassed, and even
confident in his judges’ equity. As soon as
the law process was terminated, copies of it
were sent to Zurich, Berne, Bâle, and Schaffhausen.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
The advice of Zurich was the most
severe, but Calvin’s assertion that the Protestant
cantons pronounced for the sentence
of death, is untrue. The 26th of October,
1553, the tribunal, sitting for the last time,
condemned <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servet</span> to be burned alive. When
its decision was made known to him, the firmness
he had hitherto shown gave way, and his
shrieks of terror were heart-rending. He
hoped to soften Calvin, and had an interview
with him two hours before he was led to execution,
but his fate had been long decided.
He was burned at the stake in a spot called
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champey</span>, a stone’s throw from the southern
gate of Geneva. He suffered two hours of
fearful torments, the wind blowing the flame
from him, and cried in his despair, “Unhappy
that I am, with the golden pieces and rich
collar ye took from me, ye could not purchase
wood enough to consume me quicker!”</p>

<p class='c011' >We are still here; detained by the charm of
the place and the heat, which exceeds any I
ever felt in Paris. It has been impossible to
go out except during the very brief time the
twilight lasts, when we have made excursions
on horseback in the environs to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voltaire’s
Ferney; Madame de Staël’s Coppet</span>; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
though last, not least, to Lord Byron’s villa
Diodati at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cologny;</span> the green heights on the
opposite side of the lake, and which must be
visited if you would duly appreciate its beauty.
From among its trees you look to the right far
along its clear expanse; to the left on Geneva,
by which it is closed and terminated; while
the range of the Jura stretches opposite. A
few evenings since I saw this view in the red
light of a stormy sunset, which a poet should
have described.</p>

<p class='c010' >We have had time to become familiar with
the whole establishment, even to learn that
the grave stork has a sense of ridicule more
exquisite than I believed possible in a bird.
He has the ungraceful walk of his species, and
D——, aware of his self-love, one day presumed
to imitate his hopping stride, whereupon
he flew at him in fury indescribable. I
too insulted his dignity, and was glad to summon
the German coachmaker to my assistance.
Since then the stork, who bears malice, when
we cross the yard, advances with most warlike
demeanour, and when we are put to flight,
triumphantly throws his long bill backwards,
and claps it eight or ten times in token of
victory.</p>

<p class='c010' >Certainly the Germans of the lower class
are strangely civilized, and the working coachmaker
and head waiters of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span> fair
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
specimens of it. The two latter are from the
German cantons on the Swiss frontier; they
speak French, Italian, and English fluently
as their own language, and one of them passes
his leisure hours in playing on the flute, which
he does skilfully. The coachmaker toils early
and late, almost his only time for rest being
on the Sunday, and spent by him in long walks
into the country, of whose beauty he is an
enthusiastic admirer, or in reading on the lake
shore, where we have found him several times.
Last night his workmen were in the boat,
singing in parts and splendidly; he was standing
at the edge in meditation, listening to their
fine voices borne along it, and watching the
faint summer lightning which flashed at intervals,
muttering in the pauses of their song
a poem by Kotzebue, which the scene recalled
to him. When he saw us, he was anxious that
we too should acknowledge its beauty, and
tried as he went on to translate it into his
imperfect French. He then began to criticize
Goethe and Schiller, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Staël,</span>—he
had read them all.</p>

<p class='c010' >This morning he passed in anxiety. In the
coach-house roof a swallow has built a nest,
in which the gentle creature takes great interest,
watching with solicitude the young
ones, who are just fledged, and trying their
wings. One of these was to-day too
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
adventurous, and alighted on the floor, whence he
wanted strength to reascend. The German
was absent, and D——, who found the stray
swallow, deposited him on a beam near his
abode, but not, to his patron’s dismay, within
it. When he returned, he ascended the ladder
to count his birds, and found that one was
wanting. He carried it round and round,
examined every hole and corner, peeped into
all parts of the roof, and went sadly to work,
saying, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Du moins je n’ai rien à me reprocher;”</span>
but he could not fix his attention, and every
ten minutes left his occupation to remount his
ladder.</p>

<p class='c010' >This evening, as we passed him on our way
to the park, his good-natured face had brightened;
his last pilgrimage was satisfactory, the
fugitive had returned to the nest.</p>

<p class='c010' >I have amused myself by painting from the
water’s edge a view of the lake, and its opposite
green shore, and distant mountains. The
coachmaker in ten minutes made me an easel,
and D—— particularly desires me to tell you
that I wash my brushes in the <em>lake</em>! At first
sight it disappointed me, for I had grown
accustomed to the cliffs overhanging <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>,
and the country round Geneva wants the boldness
which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> is too distant to supply;
but I have altered my opinion. Seen from
this spot it has a soft beauty which grows upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
you; it is clear as a mountain rivulet, and to
view it in all its charm you must sit here on a
sunny evening when it is sufficiently agitated
to come murmuring in small waves to your
feet, and there are just so many clouds in the
sky as to vary its water’s blue with a thousand
tints of green, and gold, and pale violet,
changing like a chameleon, while its surface
is dotted with boats sweeping along with their
elegant peculiar sails like the outspread wings
of a bird, and those shaded by bright coloured
awnings, in which the Genevese are rowed out
to catch the evening air, and pass singing and
laughing in the distance, the voices floating
to us over the expanse as if they were at our
side. The mountain, which grows higher as
it nears Geneva, is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salive;</span> the blue hill of
a conical form, the Mole; between which and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salive</span> towers <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc;</span> and beyond
the Mole, stretches along the shore the wooded
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voiron</span>. The most beautiful effect possible is
produced by a rainbow across this range of
hills. Yesterday, anxious to insert a threatening
thundercloud in my little picture, I
hurried to the shore for the purpose, forgetting
that the same cloud I admired might inopportunely
discharge itself on my head. It did
not fail, and I had only time to run to the
boat-house, which is close by, whence I peeped
through the arch at a most splendid rainbow:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
during which time the violent shower
floated my palette, and made the oil a set of
useless globules.</p>

<p class='c010' >The weather has been constantly broken by
storms, the finest and most terrific I ever witnessed.
Last night, during two hours, the
thunder, repeated by its echoes, rolled without
a pause, and the Jura was constantly illuminated
with the lightnings, sheeted, forked, or
like circles of fire, which, blazing above the
heads of the mountain range, made it resemble
a line of volcanoes. This evening we rode
again to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coppet;</span> the opposite shore, at each
step we advanced, becoming bolder; and when
we returned, the full red moon was just risen
above <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc,</span> and the yellow glitter
danced on the water in a long line, interrupted
only by the dark boughs of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span> trees,
advancing on a little promontory.</p>

<p class='c010' >The finest view of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> is from the
hilly road which leads to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ferney Voltaire,</span> and
the best hour to see it when the snow looks rosy
in the evening. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ferney</span> is on the road from
Paris to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gex,</span> and distant but a league from
Geneva. We visited it to see Voltaire’s château.
On the left, at the extremity of the
village, is the avenue which leads up the
gentle ascent to the gates; without them, on a
mound, stands the church, which once bore the
inscription, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deo erexit</span> Voltaire;” its stones,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
dark with time, quietly going to ruin under
its old trees. It was for some time the parish
church, but being no longer large enough to
contain the increased numbers, its ornaments
have been transferred to the new building
which glares with fresh whitewash in the village
below, and it is itself converted into a
receptacle for firewood. A white-headed
villager came to hold the horses in the shade,
and we followed our guide, who walked
slowly from his dwelling behind the church to
the iron gates. He was seventy-six himself,
and had served Voltaire the two last years of
his life, being his gardener’s son.</p>

<p class='c010' >On entering the house, we were sorry to be
consigned to the care of a most unintelligent
lout, who exhibits the drawing-room and bed-chamber,
illustrating, by his strange replies to
all queries, the proverb of “Ask no questions
and you will be told no lies.” These two
rooms remain in their original state, furnished
with the same tapestry chairs as when he occupied
them. In the former are the pictures
so often described, the two bad copies of
Albano, and the production of an itinerant
painter, which immortalizes Voltaire’s vanity;
a strange medley of nymphs and garlands, an
awkward Glory, the temple of Fame, Apollo,
and the author; and in the corner the latter’s
enemies, whose name seems to have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
Legion, crowded under the weight of their unsold
works and the whips of various furies.
Whether in jest or earnest, Voltaire persisted
in praising this production, and exalting its
composer as a worthy successor of Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p class='c010' >The windows of this room, and of the next
in which his bed stands in its old place, look
on the grounds he planted himself. The narrow
bedstead is of rough common wood, and
the author’s curtains have been so shortened
by the thefts of tourists, that their remnant is
at last above the reach of collectors. Against
the wall is erected a kind of cenotaph in
crockery, surmounted by a bad bust, with the
inscription, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Son esprit est partout, mais son
cœur est ici;</span>” above is written, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes mânes
sont consolés, puisque mon cœur est au milieu
de vous.</span>” You know the intention was frustrated,
as his heart is at the Pantheon in Paris.
In the same room are engravings of celebrated
men, remarkable only for having been selected
and hung there by Voltaire; a tapestry portrait
of the Empress of Russia, worked by
herself, a bad specimen of art and nature; one
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Kain,</span> the actor, crowned with bays,
hangs over the bed, and on either side that of
Voltaire in his youth, and Frederick the
Great. Voltaire’s is a more agreeable picture
than I had yet seen of him, for the sarcastic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
expression, though perceptible, is not so forcibly
marked as in later years.</p>

<p class='c010' >That of the king of Prussia was a present
from himself, and the hard blue eye and inflexible
features tell his character as well as
volumes. There are besides likenesses of
Madame Denis, Voltaire’s niece, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
du Châtelet,</span> who was, tradition says, the only
woman he ever loved; her appearance is by
no means striking; and also those of his
sweep and laundress; (an arch-looking boy,
and a girl with the face of a Madonna,) in coloured
crayons, and beautifully executed. The
books of the library marked with his own
notes were purchased by the Empress Catherine:
and the little study which adjoined his
bedroom is closed to his admirer’s eyes, being
transformed to a shoe-blacking laboratory.
We did not remain long, our before-mentioned
lout being perfectly ignorant of all which regarded
his show, and only anxious to force us
to buy some wretched lithographic drawings of
this small room, and its bedstead, and cenotaph,
in which it looks as large as a reception
chamber at Versailles.</p>

<p class='c010' >Outside the house the old gardener’s part
recommences; it would be difficult to feel no
interest in the faithful servant, whose life
seems to hang on the memory of his master’s.
He smiles and looks happy when encouraged
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
to talk of him, and is very downcast when he
finds his visitors less curious about Monseigneur.</p>

<p class='c010' >He led the way to the terrace, which commands
the fine view of the glaciers and the
lake shores. At some distance is a little wood,
where he was fond of walking, and an avenue,
planted by his orders, leads to it from the
park. “The terrace was his place for study,”
the old man said; “here he often came in the
morning to rehearse the part he was to act at
night on the stage of his own theatre, and
(dressed for it, to save the trouble of a second
toilet) he used to march backwards and forwards,
gesticulating and declaiming with great
vehemence, and giving doubts of his sanity to
men less tragically minded.” At the extremity
of the terrace is a long shady walk, a most
charming <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berceau,</span> for the hornbeam is completely
met over head. “Here,” said the
gardener, stopping almost at its entrance, “is
the very spot where Monsieur Gibbon played
the trick to Monseigneur; you recollect the
story?”</p>

<p class='c010' >We begged him to tell it. “It would do
him an honour,” he said, “but his asthma
impeded his doing so while he walked by our
side; he would stand by the bench while we
sate there.” A great deal of entreaty induced
him to sit also, but not to cover his white
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
head; that remained bare, partly in reverence
to his listeners, but more to his subject,
Monseigneur:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“Monsieur Gibbon was at Lausanne, and
Monseigneur and he, though they had never
met, were very good friends, till Monsieur
Gibbon presumed to criticize some work of
my master’s, who was very angry and bought
a caricature of Gibbon, and sent it to him
at Lausanne. I have often had the honour
of brushing Monsieur Gibbon’s coat, and
he was a very short, corpulent man, with
large head and flat nose. When he received
his picture by the post, he said he must go to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ferney</span>, and judge by his own eyes whether
Monseigneur was not his match for ugliness.
Here then he came. Monseigneur had not
forgiven the criticism, and desiring Madame
Denis to receive him, he refused to see his
visitor himself. Monsieur Gibbon said he had
come to look at Voltaire, and till he could do so,
he would stay. So Monseigneur shut himself
up in his study, and Monsieur Gibbon seated
himself in the drawing-room. He staid two
days; but the third Voltaire grew tired, and
wrote him a note to say, that <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don Quixote</span>
and he were the reverse of one another, as the
Don took inns for châteaux, while he mistook
châteaux for inns. Gibbon read the note and
went away.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
“Monseigneur had a little favourite mare,
who ate bread from his hand, and allowed him
to catch her when she would suffer no other person
to approach. Monsieur Gibbon spoke to
the groom before he went, and said he intended
to buy her, and would not forget him if he
would lead her round when he came next
morning, and let her loose beneath <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monseigneur’s</span>
windows.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The following morning at five Voltaire
heard a horse gallop, and looking from his window
saw the mare, and called angrily to the
groom, who said she had broken from him;
and out came Monseigneur with a piece of
bread in his hand to catch the favourite, while
Monseigneur Gibbon hid behind the hazel
foliage of the terrace walk, and as Monseigneur
passed jumped out on him.</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Ah,’ said he, ‘Voltaire, I have seen
you now, and you are not handsome neither;’
and turned his back on my master, who was
foaming with rage: ‘Run after him,’ he called
to his secretary: ‘and tell him to give you
twelve sous for having seen the wonderful
beast.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“The secretary made haste and came up
with Gibbon, who was walking down the avenue
to the village, where he had left his carriage.
‘Very right,’ he said, when he heard the message;
‘twelve sous for seeing the beast:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
there are twenty-four, and say I have paid for
twice, and will come back to get the worth of
my money.’ Monseigneur stamped with his
foot, and exclaimed that some future trick
would be played him. ‘We had better be
friends,’ he said to the secretary; ‘go and
ask him to dinner.’ And so, madame,” added
the old gardener, rising from the bench with a
bow, “as I told you, I have often since had
the honour of brushing Monseigneur Gibbon’s
coat.” He next stopped at a splendid tree:
“This,” he said, “was planted by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monseigneur’s</span>
own hand, and under it he received Franklin.
My father dug the hole, and he held the sapling,
the very spring I was born, seventy-six
years ago. Almost all these trees were planted
by my father, for the village stood here when
Monseigneur bought the property; it was then
only of twelve miserable huts, and he rebuilt
them lower down: when he died there were
eighty. Ah!” said the old man, sighing,
“but for his attacks on religion”—A little
further he stopped in a pretty green glade:—“Here
was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monseigneur’s</span> summer study; he
built it here to free himself from the importunity
of visitors.” When it fell into decay, the
present proprietor raised in its place a black
marble pyramid, bearing, among other inscriptions,
in his honour, one recording Voltaire’s
horror of the massacre of St. Barthelemy. One
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
night, during the year 1819, it was broken, and
its pieces scattered about by persons unknown,
and nothing now marks the spot but the regrets
of the white-headed gardener, soon likely to be
silent also. He was often employed, he said,
to carry the author’s portfolio up and down
these walks when he paced them, as was his
custom during composition. Every now and
then he signed to his attendant to approach;
wrote his notes rapidly in the portfolio, returned
it to his hands, and recommenced the promenade.
We left the park, passing the basin
full of gold and silver fish, which come shooting
to the surface at the old man’s whistle, and
passed the church on our way to his house,
which was the priest’s, and where he said he
had some “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petites antiquités</span></i>” to show us, if
we would honour him by entering. He pointed
out the tomb built against the church wall, in
the form of a pyramid. Voltaire had intended
it should contain his bones; but, like his heart,
they have had a different destination. The
theatre was within the park wall, but a few
yards from this intended grave and just opposite;
it has been taken down.</p>

<p class='c010' >The gardener’s abode was scrupulously
clean, but guarded by a dame of vinegar aspect.
Her ire was excited by the arrival of other
visitors, as she feared, from her husband’s lingering
with us, that he might miss the coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
harvest. She had lost her keys and her memory
when he demanded the various boxes which
contained his treasures; but his positiveness
conquered, and, one after the other, she produced
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monseigneur’s</span> cane, and his full-bottomed
wig, and a soiled silk cap, embroidered
and folded in five envelopes. The most interesting
appeared last, in the form of a book,
whose leaves were stuck all over with seals,
and a line in Voltaire’s handwriting under
each. He had found means of abridging the
trouble of his extensive correspondence, for
these were the correspondents’ seals, taken from
their letters, and his remarks (concisely affording
a comprehensive view of character) spared
him often the trouble of looking farther: one
was <i>Fou de Genève</i>; I saw little or no commendation.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ferney</span> is now again the property of the same
family from whom it was purchased by Voltaire;
that it has once, since his death,
belonged to an Englishman, or rather been
rented by one, is recorded in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de
Laborde’s</span> journey to Switzerland. He mentions,
that in the year 1781 he went to the
château of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ferney</span>; he was an enthusiastic admirer
of Voltaire, and the following are his
own words:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“I descended from my carriage; I approached,
impatient to exist in the same place
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>311</a></span>
where the great man lived. I rang—the gate
opened—I rushed in—I was pushed back, and
entrance refused me, because the master had
given orders to admit no one.</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘What do you mean?’ I exclaimed
hastily. ‘What kind of a master is this who
refuses to see Frenchmen? Is the château no
longer the property of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de la Villette</span>?’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Sir, he has let it.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Let it! let the remains of Voltaire?’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Only for a year.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘And who is the successor of our great
genius?’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘An Englishman.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Robertson, no doubt.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘No, a London shopkeeper with one leg,
one arm, and one eye.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Never mind, I must speak with him.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘He is not at home.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Will he soon be back?’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘I do not know.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘And where is Voltaire’s heart?’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘On a shelf in the larder.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Is it possible? let me see it for only a
moment; I will give you whatever you please.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Sir, I should be turned away.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Abominable varlet; may heaven confound
you and your master!’”</p>

<p class='c010' >Wild weather latterly; the extreme heat
having suddenly changed to storms and north-east
winds, the bise blowing a tempest, and the
waves of the lake dashing over the walls,
they till now have peaceably lain many feet
below. We have been agreeably surprised by
finding that friends, whom we believed far
away in the shade of their quiet park, are on
the continent also, and will soon join us here.
The immediate environs of Geneva so closely
resemble England, with their good macadamized
roads, bordered by park palings and
neat cottages with turf and flowers, and no
apparent poverty, that with my back turned to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc,</span> I could have believed myself in
my own country. The common people are
remarkably industrious and certainly know the
value of time,—for I constantly see young girls
and old men also walking along with a load
on their backs of fruit and vegetables to be
sold in the town, perseveringly knitting the
whole way. The Genevese are proud in their
own country: though when they emigrate, to
make their fortunes, they will toil without
murmur. The more abject and severe labour
here is performed by bands of poor Savoyards,
who arrive for the <i>lessive</i> and the haymaking
and harvest, ragged and cheerful and untiring,
like the troops of Irish who flock yearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span>
to England. They are a more gentle and
amiable people than the money-making
Genevese; but so wretched where their unproductive
territory touches that of Geneva, that,
passing the frontier and the cross with its artificial
flowers, the contrast from the clean comfort
of the Swiss to their squalid misery is
striking and sad.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Swiss troops, with the exception of the
few on permanent service, receive no pay, and
perform their duty without murmur. Every
year they pass three months encamped; so
that Switzerland might, in case of necessity,
find ready at her call an army of 180,000
men. No citizen can marry unless he possesses
bible, arms, and uniform. Each
citizen is an elector, and the elections take
place in the churches. Their penitentiaries
(for Switzerland has no punishment answering
to the English hulks or the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galères</span>) are
conducted with a view to future amelioration;
some have a small library, reading being allowed
in their hours of recreation. It is their rule,
that each man condemned to reclusion, and
not knowing a trade, shall learn one, the trade
itself resting on the prisoner’s choice, and
the two-thirds of the produce of his labour,
during his detention, belonging to himself:
of these two shares he is permitted to transmit
one to his family. The following notes are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
copied from the register of one of these
houses:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“B——, born at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bellerive</span> in 1807, miller’s
man, poor, stole three measures of grain; condemned
for two years. At the end of this
time his benefice, over and above the money
sent his family, amounted to a hundred francs.
Left a skilful weaver.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Under these lines the pastor of the village,
to which B—— had returned, had written the
following:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“On his return to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bellerive,</span> this young
man, suffering from extreme humiliation, concealed
himself in his father’s house. His
former companions, assembling in a body, went
to seek him on the Sunday, and conducted him
to church in the midst of them.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The French custom-houses are extremely
severe on the article of Genevese jewellery;
but notwithstanding all the preventive measures
adopted, the importation of smuggled
goods into France is considerable, and the
cleverness of the Genevese smugglers outwits
even the sharp French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span>. It is an
amusing fact, that when the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de St.
Cricq</span> was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Directeur Général des Douaness</span>, he
went to Geneva, and there purchased of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Beautte,</span> one of the principal jewellers,
30,000 francs’ worth of jewels, on condition of
their being smuggled into his hotel in Paris.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Beautte</span> made no objection, only
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_315' id='Page_315'>315</a></span>
presenting the buyer with a paper for signature,
by which he obliged himself to pay the
usual five per cent. on the sum due. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">directeur</span> smiled, took a pen and signed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St.
Cricq, directeur des douanes. Beautte</span> merely
bowed, and said, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Directeur,</span> the
jewels you have purchased will be arrived as
soon as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010' >At the frontier, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de St. Cricq</span> left
strict charges of surveillance, and the promise
of a reward of fifty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">louis</span> to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</span> who
should seize the jewels; but arrived in Paris
he entered his chamber to change his dress,
and the first object he saw there was an elegantly
shaped box bearing his name engraved
on a silver plate; he opened it and found the
jewels. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beautte</span> had come to an understanding
with a waiter of the inn, who, while assisting
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">directeur’s</span> people to pack the
carriage of their master, slipped the aforesaid
box among the baggage; and the valet, on
reaching Paris, noticing it for the first time,
and supposing it to contain some recent purchase
of value, immediately carried it to the
count’s private apartment. Thus, while
triple attention examined and tormented the
unoffending travellers who crossed the frontier,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons. de St. Cricq’s</span> carriage unmolested
smuggled his own contraband purchase to his
own hotel.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
The exterior of the cathedral (St. Pierre) is
simple to plainness, saving the Corinthian
portico, which forms on its surface a very inappropriate
patch. Within are interred D’Aubigné,
Henry the Fourth’s friend; and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Rohan,</span> a Protestant leader of Louis
the Thirteenth’s time. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cardinal de
Brogny,</span> who died in 1426, was buried by his
own command in the chapel of the Maccabees,
which he founded. Its carvings and paintings
had been at his desire executed to commemorate
his low origin and remarkable history,
and some of them are still preserved in
the public library of Geneva. There were a
child keeping pigs! wreaths of oak leaves and
acorns, and in another place a pair of shoes.
His name was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Allarmet,</span> and he was
born at the village of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brogny</span> in the year
1342, his parents being peasants. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brogny</span>
lies on the road from Annecy to Geneva, and
he was occupied keeping his flock of pigs,
when, some monks bound to Geneva, and uncertain
of the way, stopped to question him.
Struck by his intelligent eye and prompt
answers, they proposed to him to follow themselves,
promising to afford him means of
study, which the delighted boy eagerly accepted,
and his father consenting to his departure
he repaired to Geneva, and soon so
far distinguished himself by his premature
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
talent, as to draw upon him the attention of
a cardinal, who proposed in turn that he
should seek him at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avignon</span> and prosecute
more serious studies under his protection.
He consented with the same ardour as before,
and prepared to set forward on his journey on
foot; but he had no shoes, and he counted
the contents of his light purse in vain, he had
not enough to pay for a pair. A friendly
shoemaker, aware of his embarrassment, supplied
him with the necessary article, and said
laughing, “You shall pay me when you are
a cardinal.” At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avignon</span> the youth made
rapid progress, and rose to honour and reputation,
becoming vicar general of the archbishop
of Vienne, and charged by Pope Clement
the Seventh with the education of his
nephew; and in consequence of the manner in
which he fulfilled this last trust, created by
him archbishop of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arles</span> and cardinal. It
was then, when many years had passed, and
the shoemaker had grown old and sunk into
poverty, that his humble dwelling was sought
out by some richly attired domestics, who addressed
him by name, and asked him whether
he recollected the present he had made a poor
student, who would otherwise have been reduced
to perform barefoot his journey to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avignon</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Very well,” answered the shoemaker; “he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_318' id='Page_318'>318</a></span>
was a fine fearless boy. I could afford to be
charitable in those days, and I trust I may
receive my reward in heaven, for I have had
none on earth.” “You are wrong,” said the
domestics; “that boy is become a cardinal,
and sends to seek you that you may fill the
place of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</span> in his household.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The poor man was overjoyed, and, abandoning
his deserted stall, lived and died in the
cardinal’s service.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1414, notwithstanding <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Brogny’s</span> advanced
age, he repaired to Constance, at the
period when John Huss had been deluded
thither by the faithless Emperor Sigismund’s
safe-conduct, to defend his doctrine before the
assembled council. He presided it several
times, had daily and nightly conferences with
Sigismund, and when Huss had been cast into
a dungeon and doomed to recant what were
termed his errors, or to die at the stake,
the cardinal, compassionating his misfortunes,
visited him often in his cell, and implored as
well as reasoned with him. It was in vain,
for the reformer’s firmness was not to be
shaken. Conducted to the place of his torture,
(which is still shown at Constance,) and seeing
a female fanatic hurrying forward to cast her
faggot on the pile, he exclaimed with the
calmness of a philosophical spectator, “Oh
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sancta simplicitas!</span>” and when he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
ascended it, and the executioner, to spare him
the sight, applied his torch to that part to
which his back was turned, he said, “You
may light it before my eyes; if I had feared
fire, I should not be here now.” Even when
the flames closed round his tall figure, his
voice was heard from the midst of them
chanting a psalm.</p>

<p class='c010' >It would be too long to tell you what monasteries
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cardinal De Brogny</span> founded, and
what churches received his donations. You
will be more interested in hearing that he
bequeathed four hundred golden florins as
marriage portions to poor maidens in the
county of Geneva; a larger sum to the widows
and orphans of Annecy; and that, possessor
of forty benefices, he spent their revenues on
public works and the care of the poor.
A rule of his house fed thirty mendicants
daily, and a codicil of his will ordered that
this custom should be continued an entire
year after his death. On his return from
Constance, he visited his birthplace, the village
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brogny,</span> and, assembling in his father’s
cottage all the old men of the district, mostly
companions of his boyhood, he dined in their
company, and, inquiring into their affairs,
provided for their future comfort.</p>

<p class='c010' >He died at Rome, aged 84, and was buried
at Geneva. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span> saw his statue on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
tomb, afterwards thrown down by the Reformers;
and a later writer says it is a pity
they did so, as one would have rejoiced to see
the features of a “modest man of genius and
a tolerant cardinal.”</p>

but particularly Fanny, to the whole establishment,
including <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Dejean’s</span> sister,
we set forth; all eight packed in one of his
heavy carriages and drawn by four of his
heavy horses. It was the 3rd of August, and
a burning day. Just before the road enters
Savoy, (as it nears the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salève</span> on the right
hand and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voiron</span> on the left, and beyond
the valley through which flows the small river
Foron, you see <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> and its glaciers,)
the country loses the tamer, cultivated beauty
of the environs of Geneva, and becomes wild
and grand. At the summit of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voiron</span>, in
a desert and savage retreat, damp and cold,
and usually deep in snow, there was once a
monastery. I read somewhere that a monk,
questioned as to his sufferings, said they were
such as sometimes to drive him to desperation,
but that the Virgin gave him strength and
would reward him in Heaven with torrents
of felicity for the earthly torments he endured!
Not long ago this mountain was
the scene of a new edition of the babes in the
wood.</p>

<p class='c010' >One stormy October two young boys were
at play about four in the evening, chasing
each other over the snow. Night closed in,
and they lost their way in a thick fir-wood, unconscious
of its being close to their own home.
When it had become quite dark, and they did
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_323' id='Page_323'>323</a></span>
not return, the alarmed family searched the
forest with torches and cow-bells, and after
three hours of toil and anxiety, they were
found in a hole filled with leaves; the oldest,
nine years of age, had taken off his jacket, to
cover with it his brother, only six years old,
and was lying on him to keep him warm,
braving himself cold and death, and already
so far benumbed as to be unable to reply
to the well known voices which called on
him.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Foron rises in this mountain, and is the
Genevese boundary. We crossed it on the
wooden bridge which looks so picturesque
from the height above, and were stopped at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annemasse,</span> a little farther, to exhibit our
passports. This is the Sardinian frontier, and
we were detained some time, but no trouble
given, and the carriage not examined. We
were found <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en règle,</span> for the passports had
been <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visés</span> the night before, this being a necessary
preliminary to visiting Chamouny, and
a profitable one to Sardinia, for each visa costs
four francs.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before reaching Bonneville, which is the
chief town of the province of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucigny</span>, we
passed the ruined castle of its old barons,
which frowns on a commanding height to the
left. Its last possessor was Beatrice, grand-daughter
of Agnes, daughter of Aymon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_324' id='Page_324'>324</a></span>
second, baron of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucigny</span>, last male of his line.
Marrying the dauphin of Vienne, she bore
with her to her husband her rights over the
province, but having attained an advanced
age, family dissensions, and the ill-treatment
of her grandchildren, offspring of her daughter
Anna, induced her to pray the protection of
her cousin <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Great, count of Savoy.
Received at his court, and treated with attention
and affection, as well as with the honours
due to her rank, she resolved on proving her
gratitude by bequeathing to him all the lands,
rights, and castles she possessed over and
above her marriage portion, as well as whatever
she could alienate of her paternal inheritance.
Her will, made in this spirit, was
the cause of Savoy’s taking up arms against
Dauphiny; the one to defend the territory
just acquired, the other to resist spoliation;
and these cruel wars once kindled did not
cease entirely till Humbert the Second, last
dauphin, weary of the world when he had lost
his son, took the monastic habit, and in
1349 ceded Dauphiny to the heir of France.
The Green Count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>, disapproving of
the presence of his new and powerful neighbour,
led an army across the mountains, and
fought a pitched battle, in which he was victorious,
taking prisoners many of the chief
men there, both of France and Dauphiny.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_325' id='Page_325'>325</a></span>
The count’s prowess and power proved, the
former were satisfied with placing their interests
in the hands of arbitrators, who decided
that Savoy should remain sovereign of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucigny</span>
and Gex, while she ceded to France all
her possessions in Dauphiny beyond the Rhone
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guier.</span> The old castle passed, the road
nears the Mole, which towers in all its elevation
of 5800 feet, and we drove through an
avenue of trees into Bonneville, where we
breakfasted not badly, despite the very
poetical rhyme:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“Oh ye, who stop at Bonneville town,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'> Beware of feeding at the Crown,”—</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011' >which, if written in charity, is useless on the
dining-room shutter.</p>

<p class='c010' >The heat being intense, our horses were
rested for two hours, during which time the
coachman failed to discover a loose fore shoe,
which stopped us on the stone bridge which
crosses the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve,</span> just as we started once more,
and was remedied by a long nail, driven in
anyhow.</p>

<p class='c010' >Near the bridge is a lately erected column
in honour of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carlo Felice,</span> whose statue surmounts
it, ninety-five feet above ordinary
mortals; and in gratitude for the fresh embankments
which restrain the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve’s</span> fury
when it rushes from its mountain birthplace,
swollen by the first melting of the ice in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>326</a></span>
spring. Near their source, (the glaciers,) these
streams are more awful than beautiful; they
have the turbid hue produced by the snows
and earth they bear violently along; and in
their mildest aspect they roar in a narrow
channel, amidst the broad expanse of desolation
they have made in their anger.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our way to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cluses</span> lay between the Mole,
now near us on the left, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Brezon,</span>
whose range bounds, on the right, the rich
cultivated valley; a lovely road, but traversing
miserable villages and crowds of mendicants,
the young children with the seamed and care-worn
faces of age, and dark with emaciation.
The dreadful goitre is common here, and we
saw one unhappy cretin grinning vacantly as
he tottered along.</p>

<p class='c010' >Near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cluses</span> the road is cut between the
wall of rock and the precipices which overhang
the river; and a stony defile which it commands,
and partly fills, leads to the city, which
has the aspect of a poor hamlet. It was the
baronial capital in the time of the old lords of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucigny</span>, and conferred on those who lived
there a year and a day the title and privileges
of freemen.</p>

<p class='c010' >Leaving <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cluses</span> we entered a wild glen;
rocks arched above our heads, and the road
cut in their base, or carried over their scattered
fragments, and overhanging the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>327</a></span>
foaming below; tall oaks springing from half
detached masses, and bowed forward, as if to
measure the height of their threatened fall;
and the dark pines of each forest looking
darker from the contrasting foam and brightness
of unnumbered streamlets and small cascades.</p>

<p class='c010' >Issuing from the gorge, the mountains retreating
to the left form a semicircle; we
stopped for milk and lemonade at one of the
huts, where the cow, the goat, and the family
live happily together, being the spot whence
the indefatigable traveller (to whose class
none of our party belonged) ascends by a
mule path to the cavern of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Balme</span>. They
pointed it out on the side of one of these mountains
of the amphitheatre, eight hundred feet
above; Mrs. Starke, with more truth than romance,
compared it to the mouth of an oven!
Within, a narrow gallery widens to a vast
hall; its length is about sixteen hundred feet,
and its effect fine by the torchlight, as the roof
and walls sparkle with stalactites, which here
and there form a bright pavement to the
floor.</p>

<p class='c010' >Between <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Balme</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maglan</span> but the other
side of the mountain, is the commune of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arache</span>. Towards the close of the sixteenth
century it produced a fortunate man, in the
person of one <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nicholas Falquet</span>, who could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_328' id='Page_328'>328</a></span>
barely read and write when he left his father’s
cabin. Arrived at Vienna, in Austria, he
entered a rich merchant’s service, who, noticing
his intelligence and natural talents, allowed
him to share the studies of his heiress. The
young girl became attached to him, and his
parents, who had learned to consider him as
their son, consented to their union; but very
shortly after some sudden malady carried off
both father and mother, and either the same
stroke, or sorrow for their loss, deprived him
of his bride also. She had bequeathed to him
her entire fortune, and Nicholas returned to
the valley where he was born. There was a
peasant girl, with whom, ere his emigration,
he had been accustomed to herd flocks near
the village. She had never quitted it or forgotten
him, and after a time given to mourning,
he married and conducted her to Vienna.
Their son was created baron of the empire,
and by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Falquet’s</span> order a small but beautiful
church was erected on the site of his paternal
cottage, in the village of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arache</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >Three quarters of a league beyond <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maglan</span>
we passed the fine cascade of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nant d’Arpenas;</span>
it struck me less than on our return.
The volume of water is small, but springs
from a height of eight hundred feet, and is
scattered ere it reaches its first fall. When
we travelled the same road yesterday, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_329' id='Page_329'>329</a></span>
stream had been considerably increased by
rains, and the broad spray floated in a sunbeam,
which it seemed to have embodied with
itself and to be bearing away.</p>

<p class='c010' >At St. Martin, in the yard of the inn of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span>, we found a good-humoured fat
landlady, and the cars which were to convey
us the remainder of our journey. They have
no springs, the road does not allow of them,
and are mere benches under canopies, with
leather aprons, which will protect from rain or
can be tied up out of the way.</p>

<p class='c010' >The bridge which crosses the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve,</span> about a
hundred yards further, leads to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sallenches,</span>
and from it there is a noble view of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont
Blanc,</span> with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aiguille</span> and glacier glittering
above the nearer mountains, darkly clothed to
their summit, a view which every moment increases
in splendour as the postilion urges the
little mountain horses over the rough roads,
and beds of torrents, and bridges of loose
planks, which they tread without start or
stumble.</p>

<p class='c010' >We passed what was the lake of Chède, and
is converted, by a fall of mud and rubbish from
the mountain, into a stony wilderness, and
crossed a stream too rapid for a bridge, but
which favoured us, as the water was by no
means high, and the road is seldom in a good
condition for a week.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_330' id='Page_330'>330</a></span>
About <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servoz</span>, where the horses rested, is a
thin wood of stunted oak and cherry trees, the
latter bearing fruit of the size of a wild strawberry,
but beyond they yield to pine, and
larch, and hazel. We crossed another torrent,
the Dioza, and then indeed were in a gorge
not to be forgotten. The road skirts the base
of the Breven, with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span> on the right,
washing the foot of the mound on which rises
the ruined castle of St. Michael; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pont
Pelissier,</span> under which it dashes before; the
mountains on either side covered with pines:
but the bare wild peaks shutting in the valley
behind us, and the ridges of shining snow closing
it before.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our way lay over the bridge; for beyond,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span> raves deep below the road, and rends
itself a passage through rocks and darkness.
We crossed it on foot, and walked up a part
of the steep hill leading to the Motets, the
range which divides the valleys of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servoz</span> and
Chamouny; mighty barriers, which keep in
the mind a local habitation, even when they
want a name.</p>

<p class='c010' >We continued to toil upwards with little
space to spare between the narrow car’s wheels
and the precipice which hangs over the roaring
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span>: an inadvertent driver or unruly
horse would ensure destruction, but there is
little danger of either. We were assailed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_331' id='Page_331'>331</a></span>
innumerable beggars furnished with various
excuses for extorting money—mostly intelligent,
bright-eyed children, half-clothed and
barefoot,—offering a marigold gathered in the
valley, or a crystal found on the mountain,
and running fearlessly along the very brink
of places my head turned even to look down.</p>

<p class='c010' >From the ridge of the Motets we obtained
the finest view of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span>, henceforth
close to us, but its form, changed at that part
called the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dome de Goût,</span> hides its summit;
and descending through some fertile meadows
to Ouches, the first village in the valley, the
glaciers became visible also: their brightness
and the purity of the atmosphere making
them appear so much nearer than they really
were. I thought their size inconsiderable, but
found my mistake as the road, which now runs
directly beneath the range of this snow-king
and his vassals, passed near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Glacier des
Bossons,</span> some of whose pinnacles are sixty
and eighty feet high. Beyond us, and a league
beyond Chamouny, at the head of the valley,
we saw the Glacier du Bois, which terminates
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de Glace</span>. We crossed numerous
torrents on their moving and nervous bridges,
the waters of some clear and bright, of others
turbid as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span>, here wilder and muddier
than ever, and which we traversed to continue
our way along its right bank. The valley
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_332' id='Page_332'>332</a></span>
seen in the light of the declining sun, with its
fresh green meadows, its flax and corn fields,
its scattered cottages and shining church
spires, and black forests and snows for background,
must be the loveliest on earth. You
and I have read descriptions of tints on glaciers,
probably thinking the enthusiasm of
the traveller might slightly exaggerate; yet
I was aware they fell far short as we watched
all the changes from glittering white to pale
gold—from gold to rose-colour, and then to
violet; and then the magic hues fading by
degrees, but light lingering on the summit
even when the glaciers on its side were grey,
and the road we were going dusk; as if one
sunbeam had been left behind, dedicated to
the dome of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arriving at dark, we passed the Union,
which appears the best inn and has baths
adjoining, on our way to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel d’Angleterre</span>,
which is called so, but I think must have
lost its character. The landlord and his wife
are civil, and their charges moderate, but the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span> indifferent, and the beds bad.
D—— met an army friend whom he had not
seen since we left ——, and the conversation
became a strange medley of private theatricals
and mountain passes. Arriving latest, we
were necessarily the worse lodged: the rooms
are unceiled, and, having the stables at our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_333' id='Page_333'>333</a></span>
backs, we had overhead two pedestrians, who
packed at midnight and put on their boots at
three in the morning; and very much added
to the pleasurable sensations produced by
straw bolsters and hair mattresses, which
scratch even through coarse sheets. Our
party put itself in motion after breakfast;
Mrs. —— and her beautiful young daughter
in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaises à porteurs;</span> the rest on tall mules,
to whose backs we climbed by ladders, and
whose motion is certainly the most disagreeable
in the world, particularly as, in submission
to our guides, we left the reins untouched and
their noses as near the ground as they pleased
to lay them. My guide <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mounier</span>, whose name
I wrote down that I might find him on my
next visit, has a high claim to the character
for civility and intelligence common to his
predecessors at Chamouny. When we had
crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span> and the meadows on our way
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montanvert</span>, the path grew rough and
narrow, and rose abruptly through the pine
forest. As its zigzags are cut on the hill side,
and there is barely room for the mule and
guide, and no defence towards the precipice,
it may present some alarm to persons unused
to mountain passes, particularly as the mule
always chooses the extreme edge from its habit
of carrying burthens, and its fear of striking
them against the rock, which would precipitate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_334' id='Page_334'>334</a></span>
it below. For a considerable distance the
path is composed of irregular steps of stone,
several feet in height, and up these the mules
clamber with an adroitness and safety of which
I had formed no idea. Through the dark
branches and broken stumps we caught
glimpses of the valley, and I thought our
party looked very picturesque as it wound
along, forming a straggling line; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaises
à porteurs</span> gaining on us, whose mules patiently
followed the guides, one by one; a
little boy, who carried some spiked sticks,
holding by the tail of the last and laziest.
From a spot near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fontaine du Caillet</span>,
which is about half way, the vale and the
river, the fields and cottages, spread below
like a map brightly coloured. The guide
pointed out on the opposite mountain the
path which leads to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Flégère,</span> the
best spot for seeing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> in its splendour,
as it is upwards of three thousand feet
above Chamouny.</p>

<p class='c010' >A steep and difficult path leads down the
mountain side to the source of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aveiron.</span>
We could plainly distinguish the black arch of
the ice cavern, which terminates the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de
Glace,</span> and through whose mouth it forces its
way, and bounds forward to fling itself into
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arve</span>. Passing the fountain and its gay
troops of peasant girls assembled there with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_335' id='Page_335'>335</a></span>
fruit, milk, and lemonade, very agreeable
refreshment at that height, we crossed the
track of an avalanche, a broad line of destruction;
the firs snapped at the root and carried
away, or laid prostrate beneath the weight of
stones and portions of rock cast down from
above, looking as if some giant scythe had
mown an avenue through the pine forest from
the mountain top high over our heads down
to the valley far beneath.</p>

<p class='c010' >From this place the way grows more rugged,
and encumbered with larger blocks of stone,
but the mules climbed gallantly; and at last,
arrived at the summit, we stopped at the
pavilion opposite the older refuge built by an
Englishman, and called from him the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôpital
de Blair.</span> The view would have repaid us for
more fatigue. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de Glace</span> was directly
beneath, and opposite, the pinnacled mountains
which guard its shore. There seemed to me
no resting-place for the foot of an eagle, yet
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mounier</span> said he had often slept out on them
when hunting the chamois. The highest of
the numberless pointed rocks which shoot
upwards like white spires against the blue sky,
is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aiguille Verte,</span> for it is about seven thousand
feet above the summit of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montanvert</span>.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de Glace</span> itself is ill represented in
all the engravings I have seen, for its waves
do not resemble those of the sea suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_336' id='Page_336'>336</a></span>
frozen, while driven in the same direction by
a tempest—they rather look as if they had
been tossed by whirlwinds, and are of irregular
forms and unequal height, their flat surfaces
and pointed crests of the dull white of soiled
snow; for it rejects to its surface all impurities,
and only on looking down into its crevices
are you aware of their pale, beautiful green—the
purest and clearest in the world. You
can form no idea of the size of these waves
except by descending among them, the magnitude
of all which surrounds them deceiving
as to theirs, yet many exceed forty feet in
height; and of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de Glace</span>, which is
about eight leagues in length, two are from
this spot visible.</p>

<p class='c010' >We scrambled down by a rugged path
which leads to it from the pavilion, but it is
no place to tread without a guide, and it is
dangerous to advance too far on the edges of
these crevices, which are often unsupported
below; and some accidents generally occur to
the cattle or their drivers when in the month
of July the former are sent from Chamouny
up the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montanvert</span> and across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de
Glace</span> for the sake of the scanty pastures on
the opposite mountain. It is a melancholy
existence for the lonely herdsman who remains
to guard them during the three months of
their stay; for his solitude (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mounier</span> said) is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_337' id='Page_337'>337</a></span>
seldom disturbed except by the person sent
by the cattle owner, who carries him at the
end of the month the bread and cheese which
is to suffice for his subsistence throughout the
next; and all the time not spent in wanderings
after stray heifers he whiles away knitting
stockings. We returned to the pavilion by a
better path, beside the stone inscribed with
the names of Pocock and Windham, the two
English travellers who, in 1741, revived the
memory of the forgotten valley of Chamouny,
where a priory had been founded in the
eleventh century. We rested on this broad
stone, which was their dinner-table or bed, or
both, and the crags round which were covered
with rhododendrum, which grows wild everywhere,
brightening them with its deep red
blossom. The pavilion affords refreshment
and, if you will, beds, and a collection of
chamois horn walking-sticks, seals of crystal
and brooches of stones found on the mountain,
which distract the visitor’s attention from the
glorious view on which the windows open.
We were to be at the hotel at five, and our
mules followed, the litters as before; but I
soon found it less agreeable to feel the animal
slide down steps three feet high than climb over
them, and having borne several times, from
shame, the disagreeable sensation and the
waver it invariably makes at the sharp turns
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>338</a></span>
and the brink of the precipice, I discovered
that my sight failed, and the guide advised
walking, to myself and the lady with me; so
that walk we did, slowly certainly—for the
distance is two leagues and a half, to be performed
by a succession of hoppings on loose
stones. We passed again the fountain with
its group of smiling girls and the woman
blowing her collection of trumpets, trading,
as somebody said, with the echo; and when all
was quiet again, we heard the fall of an avalanche,
but so dull and distant it resembled
only a faint and prolonged moan. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mounier</span>
pointed out the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grands Mulets</span> on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span>,
the place where those who ascend pass the
night, four or five black rocks in the snow,
looking like monuments for the frozen. He
had been up twice himself, he said, but
meant to return no more, as the peril was too
great for a man whose father on his deathbed
had bequeathed five sisters to his care. I
was glad when we had arrived at the plain,
and could mount our mules once more, having
painfully limped the last two miles. We
arrived at the inn, where the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span> was
already filled, and did honour to ill cheer. I
was sorry to part from my poor civil guide and
promised to summon him on our next visit,
when he will probably no longer be there, for
he was a delicate looking man with a hectic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_339' id='Page_339'>339</a></span>
colour in his cheek, and the inhabitants of
Chamouny, from the sudden changes of temperature,
are subject to inflammatory maladies.
They bear a high character as being honest,
faithful, and charitable, and their courage is
incontestable, as it is with them a thing of
course to risk their lives if those of their employers
be in peril. The orphans and old men
who have no means of subsistence are supported
by all the inhabitants of the parish,
each in turn, and among those who have property,
should there be one precluded by age
or infirmity from cultivating his field, his
neighbours till it for him. They are rarely
tall or handsome, but muscular and strong,
and from their climate and exposure to its
vicissitudes, seldom attain old age. In their
season of forced idleness, the winter, which
lasts about eight months, some play high,
others drink immoderately. Their harvests
chiefly consist of flax, barley, oats, beans, and
potatoes; the latter grow in abundance, and
they make a kind of bread from their flour. I
paid a visit to the mineral baths which, notwithstanding
their unpleasant odour, I recommend
to all whose limbs are wearied with
mountain excursions, and then crossed the little
bridge near the hotel, and sat till dark, looking
our farewell at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> and his rainbow,
and annoyed by the only nuisance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_340' id='Page_340'>340</a></span>
valley, girls and boys exhibiting and persecuting
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marmottes</span> and young eagles. We
were up at five and on our way before the sun
was above the mountain, so that we saw its
visage of all hours. I should not choose
sunrise, for as the mist rises, the brilliancy it
receives from the rays which cross it hides the
mountains behind; but, as we proceeded further,
nothing could be more beautiful than to see
the ray lying on the summit of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Glacier
des Bossons</span> like a thread of silver, and the
valley of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Servoz</span> was far lovelier with the tops
of its pines just touched with light, and their
long shadows in the valley, than seen under a
mid-day sun. From St. Martin, where we breakfasted,
our fat coachman resumed possession of
our persons, and safely deposited them in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span>, where we found Fanny well, and the
hotel very comfortable after mountain inns and
mountain passes.</p>
<div class='c012'><span class='small'>13th August.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Our friends being gone, and ourselves finding
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span> too silent and sad after their
departure, we left it yesterday morning to
sleep at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morges,</span> and were fortunate in a cool
cloudy day. Hoping to escape some of the
laughter and hooting, which have greeted me
everywhere save in Savoy, I adopted the large
round straw hat such as they wear themselves,
but without its producing any beneficial effect
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_341' id='Page_341'>341</a></span>
on their manners. The road passes through
the village of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Versoix</span>, which was French property
in Louis the Fourteenth’s time, and
destined by the angry king to outdo Geneva
as a trading town. The pier and streets were
marked out, but the buildings have proceeded
so slowly, that Voltaire’s sarcastic lines are still
true:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Versoix nous avons des rues;</span></span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais nous n’avons point de maisons.</span></span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >We were now in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Canton de Vaud,</span> and
next appeared <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coppet</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Staël’s
château,</span> to which, as I told you, we rode before,
but without seeing more than its outside, as
the family was there. I understand that
strangers are at no time allowed to visit the
monument, where she lies near her father and
mother, and it is wholly concealed from view
by the fine trees which shade it. We rode
through the suburb of Nyon, admiring the
zigzag road which leads to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Cergues,</span> across
the Jura, now towering nearer and darker.
The lake grows more interesting (its broadest
part is from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rolle</span> to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thonon</span>, three-quarters
of a league), and the country round more
wooded. We fed the horses at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rolle,</span> and
rested some time at the Tête Noire, a clean,
quiet-looking inn, where one might pass a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>342</a></span>
night comfortably. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> was invisible,
but the rocks of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Meillerie</span> appeared, and the
approach to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morges</span> is picturesque beneath
dark and old trees,—the pretty arbour and
old castle of Wufflens on the right. The
improving system has not wholly spared the
latter; but its tall <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donjon</span> and the turrets
which flank it are well preserved, considering
the circumstance of its being built in the
tenth century by Bertha of spinning memory,
mother of Hugh, king of Italy, and Guy, duke
of Tuscany. Notwithstanding the saddle, with
its place to hold the distaff, exhibited as hers
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Payerne,</span> and the assurance that she spun
while she rode chargers more docile than belong
to the idler daughters of our day, I am inclined
to doubt the tradition, as her court of
Tuscany was most brilliant beneath her sway,
and she is renowned as one of the most ambitious
women who ever sat on an Italian throne;
and from her beauty and talent, she drew her
husband into various wars,—obtained and preserved
influence over the most powerful of the
country,—and more than once disarmed the
anger of those princes she had offended. We
stopped to sleep at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Couronne,</span> a comfortable
inn, and left the next morning, intending
to remain at Lausanne the following day. It
is only a post and a half distant, and the ride
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_343' id='Page_343'>343</a></span>
was very beautiful, but the flies tormenting
and the heat excessive. A steep hill leads to
the town, built on a lower slope of the Jura. As
we ascended, leaving on the right the road to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ouchy,</span> where I believe there is a good inn
(the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ancre,</span> more agreeably situated on the
lake shore), the view of the town and cathedral
opened grandly on us; and from the promenade
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montbenon</span> at its summit, that of the blue
lake below, and the bold crags shutting it in,
was superb. I should not, however, like to
sojourn at Lausanne, many of whose steep
crowded streets have no prospect of the beauty
which surrounds them, running parallel to the
lake, and some communicating with each other
by stairs as at Lyons, so that a walk to the
shore and back may resemble an hour in a
treadmill. The outside of the cathedral is of
a bad Gothic architecture; its interior the
finest in Switzerland, and contains the monument
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Eighth of Savoy, <i>alias</i>
Pope Felix, and that of Otho of Granson.
The noble <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bernard de Menthon</span> is buried here
also. Passed the new “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel Gibbon,</span>” built
on the site of the historian’s house, and up the
steep street to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucon.</span> I dismounted,
and the fat innkeeper came rolling along the
corridor, at the slowest possible pace, to meet
me in the hall. Whether he was or not turning
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_344' id='Page_344'>344</a></span>
in his mind the best method of proving
himself a true falcon, by his treatment of his
prey, I cannot tell; but he meditated his
answer for a minute ere it was made, during
which minute D—— was sitting one kicking
horse and watching another, the flies and sun
increasing his ill-will every second,—so that
when I had left the heavy host and his two
waiters standing in readiness to conduct us,
and returned to request him to dismount, I
found him decided on going on. How long the
great man and his two satellites stood on the
first step of the stair I cannot say, as I mounted
Fanny, and we took the turn to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>.
Almost the whole way lies between low stone
walls, winding high above the lake, and looking
down the precipices on its magnificent
scenery. There is little or no shade, as vineyards
in terraces clothe the steep side of the
mountain, and when these cease, a wall of rock
reflects the sun, giving the heat an intensity
oppressive to all, saving the myriads of active
lizards who shot over the sand. Surmounting
one tall crag is a square castle, of the form and
size of those so often met with in Ireland,
perched on a height it would have puzzled
our feet to attain. Over the rocks, on the lake’s
opposite side, hung a light mist, rather enhancing
than robbing them of their grandeur. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>345</a></span>
rapid descent leads to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>, which lay smiling
in the evening glow with its sleeping lake and
green woods and sunny mountains, and the
gray church tower, flanked by four turrets,
among its trees on the hill above the town.
Beyond <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> we saw <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span> indistinctly
through the haze, which cast its magic and
mystery over the dim gorge of the Rhone,
and the gigantic peaks which terminate it,
whose white brows shone through brightly,
though at intervals, like pure actions refuting
calumny.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having mistaken first our way and then the
inn, we at last dismounted at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Couronnes,</span>
second in comfort to only the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secheron</span>.
Its proprietor is building an hotel, which will
replace this, larger and more commodious, and
commanding the view, whose beauty is not to
be surpassed. At the extremity of the market-place
is a boulevard and a grove,—the
roots of whose trees the lake washes: we
sat there till after nightfall. The thin mist
still lay on the surface, smooth as a mirror,
reflecting the dark branches and old irregular
houses, with the curving shore to the left;
where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span> stood forth a white mass on the
water, with all its associations,—the reformer’s
sufferings, and the poet’s song. Above the rocks
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Meillerie</span>, opposite us, the moon was rising,—yet
too young to diffuse more than the faintest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>346</a></span>
glow. The picturesque boats of the lake lay
motionless, or rowed past slowly and silently
without a breath in their sails; it was like a
lake in a dream.</p>
